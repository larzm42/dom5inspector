The Condor is sacred to the people of Nazca. It is considered a messenger of the sun and herald of storms. The sacred bird is sometimes summoned by the Sun Kings to aid armies or to patrol the lands. No other bird can soar at such heights, thus Condor scouts are rarely seen and almost impossible to catch.
