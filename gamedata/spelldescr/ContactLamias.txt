The caster performs the rites necessary to summon Lamias, serpent women, to aid him. The more powerful the mage, the more Lamias will arrive to aid the caster. They have amazing regenerative abilities and when killed, will transform into black serpents and continue fighting. If a Lamia is killed a second time, however, she will remain dead.
