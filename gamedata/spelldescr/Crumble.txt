The caster unleashes great power upon a besieged castle. The walls of the castle will fall apart and debris will crash down upon the unwary defenders. The walls will take 250 points of damage, or more, if the caster is exceptionally powerful. Each skill level beyond five reduces the Defence value of the fortress by 25 additional points.
