The caster creates a perpetual stable wind in a coastal province that enables merchants to quickly sail to and from the province. The trade wind increases income from the province by 25 percent for the duration of the enchantment. The spell lasts longer for every gem spent on the ritual. The enchantment will dissipate if the province is lost.
