This spell can only be cast in a cave province. In the beginning of time there was a war among gods, and a previous Pantokrator defeated and imprisoned three mighty gods and their servants in the depths of the earth. The caster locates such a sealed chamber of the under-earth and releases it's entombed prisoners. The released ones' souls were imprisoned along with their bodies and could not escape to the underworld when they died. For millennia their spirits have remained trapped in their fossilizing bodies. When they are released they once more follow their former kings and sages to answer the call of the caster. Their Sages are skilled in earth, death and sometimes astral magic. If cast in a province of fortune or magic, a king with more sages is likely to be found.
