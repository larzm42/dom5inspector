The caster forms several clay figures and gives them enchanted life. The Claymen are stronger than humans, never rout and regenerate damage. The Claymen are given hammers to fight with. Powerful mages can create more Claymen with each casting of the spell: each skill level beyond the first gives one additional Clayman.
