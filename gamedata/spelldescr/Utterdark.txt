The world is covered by a blanket of utter darkness. All living beings must use torches to see even a few feet in front of themselves. Undead, Demons and blind beings are unaffected by the darkness. All provinces except caves and deep seas have their income and resources reduced by 90 percent. During the perpetual night, forces of darkness and roaming shades will attack enemy provinces. The spell lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
