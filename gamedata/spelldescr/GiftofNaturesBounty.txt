All life in the God's Dominion is blessed. Grain grows more quickly, the mustard tastes better, the ducks are fatter and all living creatures mate and give birth to young. The income of lands under the God's Dominion is greatly increased. The enchantment lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
