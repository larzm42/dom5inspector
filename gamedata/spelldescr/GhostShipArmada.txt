This spell will awaken the dead Admiral Torgrin and make him fight for your cause. The Admiral will attack random coastal provinces controlled by your enemies. The enchantment lasts until it is dispelled, the caster dies, or the Admiral and his armada are defeated. If the Admiral is not completely defeated, the entire armada will be renewed for the next battle.
