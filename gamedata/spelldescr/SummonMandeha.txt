The Mandehas are huge and horrible Rakshasas intent on one goal and one goal only: To gobble up the sun and plunge the world into eternal slumber. As eternal enemies of the sun, they are surrounded by perpetual darkness, for the rays of the sun fear them. The Mandehas are huge, monstrous beings with great wings, horns and burning red eyes. Their hatred for the sun comes with a price. All fires recognize them for what they are and will burn them severely. Anyone fighting with the Mandeha will soon suffer from its will to plunge the world into slumber and fall asleep.
