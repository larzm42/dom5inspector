The caster makes ten Mechanical Men to serve him. The fragile skeletal structure of the construct is covered with full plate armor and the construct is given a metal shield and a sword. The iron men are not affected by heat, cold, shock or poison. They are mindless, magical beings that will cease to function when left without magical leadership.
