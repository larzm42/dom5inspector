The Air mage summons a whirlwind in a province of his choice. The whirlwind will try to find a commander in the province and transport him to where the Air mage is located. This spell is an effective way to rescue cornered commanders, but it can also be a very effective way to get enemy commanders out of the way. Large beings are difficult or impossible to lift, as are powerful Earth mages.
