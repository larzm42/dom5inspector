The caster summons fifteen Kydnides, warrior Naiads willing to leave their native river to wreak vengeance upon those who harm the rivers of the world. Kydnides manifest themselves as incredibly beautiful women dressed in gleaming bronze armor. Unlike other Naiads, Kydnides do not die if they leave their home.
