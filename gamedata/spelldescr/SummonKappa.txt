The Kappa is a scaled humanoid with a turtle shell on its back. It is a being of water and haunts rivers and wild coasts. The Kappa has a water-filled depression on the top of its head. If this water is spilled, it loses its strength. In battles on dry land, the Kappa will gain fatigue until unconscious. It is also a master of Koppo, the bone breaking technique. The Kappa is also able to mend broken bones if it suffers injury.
