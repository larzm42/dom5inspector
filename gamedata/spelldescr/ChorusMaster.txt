The witches and bards of Man have developed the spell singing techniques of the Tuatha further. Through communal chanting they are able to strengthen the arcane harmonies of their spell songs. Chorus masters decide what spellsongs the chorus will chant. The fatigue that comes from casting spells will be distributed among all chorus members and the chorus master will also be able to cast more powerful spells than she could alone. While in communal chorus, all spells that only affect the caster will affect all the chorus slaves as well. A chorus with two slaves will grant all masters one extra level in all their paths, four slaves will grant two levels, eight slaves will grant three levels, and so on. Only spell singers can cast this spell. Chorus masters can use regular communion slaves.
