Devils will appear in the dreams of some unfortunate enemies whenever they try to sleep. These Devils, through various threats, will try to persuade their victims to sell their souls and join in the killing of their own commander. The strength of the threats depends on the strength of the God's Dominion, but extreme courage is always required to defy the Devils. The Devils are totally powerless if they are unable to persuade any victims, which may well happen should the enemy commander be more feared than they are. The spell lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
