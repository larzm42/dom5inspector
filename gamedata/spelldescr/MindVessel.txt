This ritual puts a part of the Aboleth's mind in the humanlike vessel that has been bred for this purpose. After the ritual the vessel will have little left of its own mind and the Aboleth part will have to guide it along. After the merging of minds the vessel will be able to use its old magic knowledge as well as that of the Aboleth. The state of the Aboleth is constantly influencing its vessel and should the Aboleth die the vessel will not survive for more than a few days at the most. An Aboleth can not share his mind with more than one vessel at a time.
