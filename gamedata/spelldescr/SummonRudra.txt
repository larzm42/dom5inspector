The caster summons one of the Rudras from the Celestial Spheres. Rudras are raging demigods of destruction armed with enchanted weaponry, thunder and plague. They bring death by arms or sorcery to mortals and demons alike. Their bows strike the targets with plague and their swords are the bane of demons. The Rudras are sprung from hurricanes and are able to fly even during storms. Their sorcerous might is directed towards destruction and they never pause to study or forge items.
