The caster unleashes the Erinyes upon the world. The Erinyes are three horrible spirits of vengeance that punish those who slay innocent women. In elder times, they upheld the ban against Blood magic, but they have since returned to the darkness whence they came. They are sometimes called the Eumenides, the Kindly Ones, but their true names are Avenger of Murder, Grudging Anger and The Unrelenting One. They will continue to hunt down murderers and Blood mages until the world is free of these evildoers. Sinners will hear the horrible baying of the sisters and madness will strike them unless they are found and most gruesomely slain by the sisters. The Kindly Ones remain in the world until the enchantment is dispelled or the three of them are slain.
