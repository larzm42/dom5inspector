This spell transforms the caster's entire army into a legion of half-frozen apparitions. All beings in the army become pale and cold to the touch. The half-frozen warriors are highly resistant to heat and flames. It also reduces the heat effects from fiery creatures, such as Abysians and Salamanders.
