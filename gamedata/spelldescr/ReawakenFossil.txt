Abysian mages have recently discovered a gorge near the borders of Gath, where ancient magic has been uncovered by eroding winds and a mighty earthquake. Huge bones were found protruding from the very stone. Legends of the glorious victory against the Rephaim were remembered and soon the Abysian mages were trying to reawaken the fossilized giants once defeated by fire in the valley of Megiddo.
