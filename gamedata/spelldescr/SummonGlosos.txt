The caster travels to a graveyard and summons the vile sows known as Glosos and binds them to his service. The Gloso or Glow Sow is a horrible dark boar with glowing eyes and razor sharp bristles on its back. They live in ancient dolmens or graveyards were they sharpen their bristles by scrubbing them against the gravestones. Glosos fight by running at its target and slicing him with the bristles on its back.
