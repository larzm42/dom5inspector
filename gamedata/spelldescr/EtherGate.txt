This ritual opens a gate to the Astral Plane and summons a clan of Ether Warriors led by an Ether Lord. The Ether Warriors were banished from this world in ancient times. Their wars drained the world of Arcana and they were forced to enter other realms of existence in order to continue their clan wars. The lesser races and their gods sealed the Astral Gates to rid the world of the plague. Ether Warriors are, naturally, ethereal and thus very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons. They use Moon Blades, magical swords that cause additional damage to magical beings. When the gate opens vast powers are released and the magic level is increased in the province.
