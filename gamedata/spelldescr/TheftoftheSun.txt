Since the disappearance of the Sun, the Zotz have longed for the warmth and reputed splendor of the celestial entity. With this spell the sorcerer lures the Sun from its heavenly abode to once more travel through Xibalba during the night. But the intent is a malicious one, for once the Sun has entered the labyrinthine caverns of Xibalba it is led astray and trapped in the Cavern of the Sun, giving its splendor to the Sun Guides and its fiery magic to the Ah K'in. With only the moon and the stars lighting the sky, the world is plunged into darkness.
