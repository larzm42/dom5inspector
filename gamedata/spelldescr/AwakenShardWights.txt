Shard Wights are reanimated Pale Ones taken from their final resting places to serve a Ktonian necromancer or an Oracle of the Ancients as guardians or company. Since the Breaking of the Seal it is no longer difficult to coerce the spirits of the dead, and shards of enchanted obsidian can be found near the Chamber of the Broken seal. These shards are crafted into cursed weapons and given to the Shard Wights.
