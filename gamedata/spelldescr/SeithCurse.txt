Seith is an ancient form of sorcery, reputedly invented by Angerboda. It has been practiced by females of the nation through the ages. Gygjor, vaetti hags and human Seithkonur all have some knowledge of the Seith, but it is the Seithkonur of Utgård that have mastered the art. Seith can be used to spell doom upon a distant target. When cast a single enemy commander in a faraway province is cursed for the rest of his life. However, the price is high, and the Fates will keep the balance. Someone close to the caster will also suffer a curse.
