The monks of Jomon have for centuries used five hand gestures representing the five peaceful aspects of the Lord. The welcoming sign allows the monk to reach out to the unwary with the comfort of the divine hearth. Enemies that perceives the gesture abandon their misdirected allegiances and turn their efforts to the true Lord.
