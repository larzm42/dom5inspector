By sacrificing a large number of blood slaves, the caster attracts attention from the Netherworld. Fiends from beyond grant the caster tremendous physical and magical power (magic bonus: 2) for one battle. The price for this power is unwanted attention from other Horrors. For every minute the battle lasts, there is a chance that a Horror will materialize in the vicinity of the caster.
