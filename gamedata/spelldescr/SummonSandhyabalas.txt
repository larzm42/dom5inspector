The Sandhyabalas, Strong-in-Twilight, are demon ogres of the night. They can only be summoned at dusk and their powers are greatest in darkness. Sandhyabalas are demon warriors of great renown, but they are even more vulnerable to fire than other Rakshasas. They wield magical moon blades that cause additional harm to magical beings.
