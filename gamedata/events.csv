One man ruled the emerging civilization. When nearing the end of his days, he turned to Dark Arts to prolong his life and his rule. This corrupted the king's soul and in the end he used the lifeforce of all his subjects and that of the fertile land itself to avoid death. The kingdom was laid to waste, its soil barren and its people destroyed, their bleached bones littering the land. Some say his magic still lingers. Some say the ruins deep in the wasteland are no longer silent and that the lamentation of its long lost inhabitants can be heard faintly when the desert wind blows from the east.	0x4600 1|turn 12|capital 0|unique 1|freesites 2|waste 1|code 0	code -62|incscale2 Death|unrest 2
