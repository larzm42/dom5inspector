A pendant set with three enchanted Eye Agates. The stones are powerful charms against Labashtu, the disease demon, but will also grant the pendant's wearer enhanced awareness and will warn him of impending danger. The wearer can cure diseased soldiers. The wearer can also be protected by twice as many bodyguards as usual during assassination attempts.
