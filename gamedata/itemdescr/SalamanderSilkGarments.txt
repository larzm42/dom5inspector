The cocoons are unwound by the ladies of the Sublime Palace, and spun into cloth and dresses. These dresses protects it's wearer from heat and flames and, in order to be cleaned and washed, are cast into flames that burn the stains away. These dresses are so finely woven that every observer is struck by their beauty and brilliance.
