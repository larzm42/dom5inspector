Forging armor for the huge minotaurs is quite expensive, so only the elite war minotaurs are allowed to wear armor. Armored in plate cuirasses and helmets in addition to their own thick hides, the war minotaurs are as heavily armed as any human infantry. Add to this their huge size and strength and they can be considered the most powerful heavy infantry in the world.
