Ashmedai is one of the Demon Lords. He is the lord of lust and revenge and all souls who succumb to these sins are his to claim. His mere presence causes promiscuity, violence and unrest. Virgins flock to him and he will use them in gruesome ways. Ashmedai is always accompanied by a handful of demon lovers and anyone who wants an audience with the Prince of Lust must face their sadistic whims before being allowed into the presence of the demon lord.
