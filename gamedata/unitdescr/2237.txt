From the depths of the temple marsh a mythic race of giants have returned as promised in ancient murals. Called Sobeks, these giants never stop growing and the oldest and strongest of them have received sacred status and are given special attention and training at the great temple. Here the Sobek Sacred Guard perform the execution of criminals and feed on the remains in a gruesome spectacle witnessed by the rich and the faithful to remind them of the final judgment in the underworld. The Sobeks are greatly feared by the herbivore C'tissians, but the predator lizards view their arrival as a sign of a promised future.
