Achillia is an enkidu born with another name in the distant lands of the enkidus. When a raiding army conquered her home she was captured and sold as a slave to an arena master in an Ermorian border province. Since then she has been forced to fight men and beasts in the arenas of the empire. Her reputation has grown as has her skills in combat. Her master once told her that she could buy her freedom if she earned him enough gold, but whenever she asked he always postponed her release. When she confronted him a final time and refused to fight anymore he became furious. Achillia got her freedom, but her master tricked her and placed a cursed collar around her neck. Lost of free will she ended up fighting for anyone who gave her orders. Her former reputation caught the attention of the emperor and she became enrolled in the armies of the awakening god.
