The Vanabog is an ancient Vanjarl from Vanheim. When the Vanir arrived in the lands of the Chuds and the Rusians they founded Novgård and expanded their kingdom. The Vanabogs and their Vanir became rulers of the land. The Vanir are few in number, but reign with their magic might and superior skill. The Vanabogs were prominent Vanjarls, but their powers are not as great as those of the Vanadrott rulers of Vanheim.
