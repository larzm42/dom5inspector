In Caelum the Eagle Kings disappeared long ago and were replaced as rulers by High Seraphs. In the distant mountain realm of Nazca the descendants of the Eagle Kings remained in power and claimed religious as well as temporal power. They called themselves Sun Kings, Incas, and they made religion permeate society. As high priests, mages and kings they concentrated power to their capital and the royal families. Two families became dominant and one of them produced kings, the other produced queens. When an Inca dies, his spouse sacrifices herself to be mummified together with him in a mummy bundle. The mummy is then brought to the Tombs of the Sun and given proper dues and a stipend to last for eternity. If the Inca doesn't yet have a spouse a young and untrained Virgin of the Sun will sacrifice herself instead.
