When the Vanir first arrived in the lands of Rus they met another exalted race. The Chuds had the beauty and might of the Vanir and some were able to change their shape into great bears. At the Pine of Skulls the Chuds feast upon bear hearts to incorporate the spirit of the bear into their bodies. When they are wounded, their flesh is filled with the rage of the bear and they are transformed. Chud Skinshifters don't have the regenerative powers of the wolven skinshifters of Vanheim, but they have remarkable recuperative powers, and can heal even the most gruesome wounds over time.
