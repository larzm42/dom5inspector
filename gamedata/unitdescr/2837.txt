The Korybants are sacred war-dancers of human origin. During the Telkhine reign humans were never initiated in the mysteries of the sacred dance. They were limited to mundane dances mimicking the Hekaterides at best. Now with the imminent awakening of the Lord the Meliai are searching for new adherents and war-dancers. They found new temples on distant shores where the sound of ancient cymbals once more arouses the spirits of dancing men. In the temples Korybant couples are trained as war-dancers able to enter a berserk frenzy when blessed by their Meliai leaders. The war-dances are not well suited for formation fighting and Korybants take up more space on the battlefield than ordinary troops.
