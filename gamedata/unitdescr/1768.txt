A Barghest is a huge, black fay hound. They once roamed the plains of Fomoria, but with the coming of man, they have retreated and all but disappeared. Some can still be found haunting the highlands where they attack weary travelers at night. Barghests are said to be manifestations of darkness and ill fates and anyone striking a Barghest may be cursed for the rest of his life. Barghests are sacred and can be blessed. They are stronger when fighting in total darkness.
