The Dagon is a monster of the deeps born at the dawn of time. It is the progenitor of the Atlantian race and has been worshiped by Atlantians and humans of coastal settlements for millennia. The monster could sleep for centuries, but when it awoke earthquakes and tidal waves threatened the creation of the previous Pantokrator. The Pantokrator sent his generals into the depths to slay the monster but the Dagon devoured them all. The Pantokrator commissioned his foremost craftsman to forge a net from the intestines of seven primordial monsters. The marshal of the Celestial Host was given authority to use the net and the Word of the Pantokrator and The Dagon was finally defeated and imprisoned for millennia. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the prison is failing and the Dagon is stirring, earthquakes and tidal waves herald his awakening.
