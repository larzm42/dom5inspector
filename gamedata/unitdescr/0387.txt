The Neteret is a giant of divine heritage. She was once the wife of a previous Pantokrator, and was given knowledge of all names and the deeper arcana. When her husband was slain and dismembered in a rebellion of lesser gods, she gathered his body parts and returned him to life. However, his death meant that he was for eternity banished to the Underworld. The rebellious pretenders imprisoned her and a new Pantokrator came to rule. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator her prison weakens and She of Many Names is once more worshipped as Mistress of Magic and Lady of This World.
