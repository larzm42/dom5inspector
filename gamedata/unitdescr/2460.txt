The Statue of Fertility is a primordial spirit of fertility that once served a previous Pantokrator and brought life to the world. When the creation was full of life, its services were no longer needed and the spirit was bound in a huge stone statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshipped as a reawakening god. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
