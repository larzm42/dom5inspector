No cynocephalian tribe has developed a reputation as those of Gog and Magog. Being the largest and most savage of all cynocephalian tribes, they are the true power behind the victories of Magnificent Ind. While Gog is dominated by warlords using armors of Indean design, the tribe of Magog is ruled by savage shaman matriarchs. Magog field the most cruel warriors of all cynocephalians, the Flesh-Hunters. The Magog Flesh-Hunters sneak into enemy lands to waylay travelers and hunt for human flesh. They are skilled with bows, but prefer to slaughter their enemies with teeth and daggers. Magog Flesh-Hunters are exceptionally efficient plunderers, and cause unrest and widespread panic in the lands they visit.
