The Knights of Man are nobles trained to battle from childhood. They are skilled in swordplay, music and horsemanship. In the time of Logris the rival petty kings gathered groups of influential and skilled warriors to their cause. Now the descendants of these first Logrian nobles have become the ruling class of Man. Many of them are Logrian full bloods and are stronger then most men.
