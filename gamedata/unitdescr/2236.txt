With the spread of the C'tissian miasma ancient beings have awakened in the temple marsh. Previously only known to myth these giants have answered the call of the awakening god and joined forces with the lizard race. Sobeks are huge reptilian beings resembling crocodiles rather than lizards. Their hides are thick and their jaws are strong. They eat meat, eggs and small lizards and most C'tissians fear them. Many are those who have warned that the Sobeks will spell the destruction of the kingdom with their hunger and unspeakable practices. The predator lizards on the other hand secretly hail the arrival of the Sobeks as the dawn of a new era.
