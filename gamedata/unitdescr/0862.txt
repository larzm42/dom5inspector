The Vampire Queen is an ancient sorceress who has changed her very essence by imbibing the sacrificial blood of virgins. This vile act has granted her the power of immortality and now she is claiming godhood, too. Vampires will come to her aid when her Dominion is strong. Vampires are totally unable to enter underwater provinces.
