Since ancient times Swans are revered in Kernou and the land of the ever young. Swans have often settled in sacred groves and castle gardens of the Tuatha and the Kernou tribe considered the birds almost sacred. With the reemergence of Ker-Ys blessed swans were given the Kernou by their Morgen rulers and now every sacred grove is attended by a swanherd caring for his flock. Swans are not very strong, but they can be aggressive when defending their homes or when responding to the calls of their swanherds. In battle they are mostly used to harass archers and lightly armed troops.
