The Saoi, also called the rescued ones, are sacred war-dancers descending from the Kouretes of ancient Therodos. They were blessed and protected from the wrath of the sea and their shrines and temples can still be found on remote islands. Their ancestry has given them the power to enter the sea, although they are better fit for fighting on dry land. They are trained as couples and led by female war-dancer generals that bless them and arouse their fury. The war-dances are not well suited for formation fighting and Saos take up more space on the battlefield than ordinary troops.
