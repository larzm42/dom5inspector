The Jinnun are magical beings closely attuned to the essence of arcana. Since the City of Brass was sealed, the Jinnun haunt the ruins known to man as Iram of a Thousand Pillars. Men of the deserts have come to Iram and become servants of the Jinnun. The Jinn Sahara have rewarded loyal men with magical gifts and the blessings of the Jinn. All of the Unseen are able to use minor magical tricks, but arcane studies come naturally to them and there are many who have become sages and sorcerers of remarkable power. While not as strong as the Ifrit Sultans they serve, these Jinn Sahara display formidable power over the elements from which they are born. They can also obfuscate their surroundings and hide a small entourage with illusions and tricks of the mind.
