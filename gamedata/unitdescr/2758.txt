The Onaqui of Xibalba are demonic beings created by the Lords of Death to cause misery and suffering to the living. The oldest and most powerful of the Onaqui  sometimes emerge from the darkest caverns of Xibalba to wreak havoc upon men. Chamiaholom is one of these ten Onaqui. He is the Skull Staff, who causes bodies to decay and turn to skeletons. He often works with Chamiabac, the Demon of the Bone Staff.
