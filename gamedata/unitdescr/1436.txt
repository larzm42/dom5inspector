The Mujina is a strange apparition that appears as a comely young maiden dressed in pure white. When she gets close to her intended target, she reveals her true appearance. The Mujina is actually faceless and horrible to behold. The sight of her will make men turn and flee or become mad with fear. Mujinas use their powers to get close to important people and drive them mad or kill them.
