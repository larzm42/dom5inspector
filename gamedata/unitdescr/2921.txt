Ys is ruled by sorceresses descending from the Tuatha that fled the fall of Tir na n'Og. When Ker-Ys was hidden beneath the waves and the Tuatha sequestered themselves, they slowly adapted to a life under water and were transformed into Morgen, semi-divine beings revered by the Merrow of Ys. Most Morgen train as knights, but the older and wiser Morgen often give up their arms and turn to studies in the magic arts of their ancestors. Morgen, like their Tuatha ancestors, are skilled in the use of glamour and Air magic, but with their transformation into Morgen they have adapted and mastered other paths.
