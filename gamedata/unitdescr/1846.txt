Kin-Breaker was the son of Ogon, founder of the Agarthan kingdom. Since the failure and destruction of the Agarthan army, his true name is no longer spoken. During the Agarthan conquest of the sunlit world, Kin-Breaker led the armies as he had underground, with strategies unfit for a sunlit world of no boundaries. Outshot, outflanked and outwitted, his royal army was annihilated. The mutilated body of the Oracle Prince was returned to the deeps where an onyx statue was crafted in his image, black as the memory of the defeat. It was placed in the Chamber of the Seal and perhaps as a result of this, a remnant of Kin-Breaker's memories lingered on in the black colossus. Somehow it gathered wisdom and somehow it gathered might. Then came men and the statue was adorned with gold and worshipped by wretched little beings. But the beings would aid it where once it had failed. And it decided it would move.
