Mamich Lum, the Grandmother Earth, is an ancient Basalt Queen who found her way into the flooded caverns ages ago. She and her consort Mam Lum led the conquest of the Xibalban underworld. But her mate was struck by sleepiness and fell into torpor soon after the flooded city was claimed. While Mam Lum sleeps in the darkest depths of Xibalba, Mamich Lum has guided the Bacabob and instructed them to learn the secret dark arts from the Zotz and then teach it to her. Mamich Lum has forsaken the old ways and practices magic never used by the Atlantian Basalt Queens. The gathering of magic knowledge has become an obsession to the ancient Queen. Silently watching her sleeping consort, she awaits his awakening, reinventing the rituals of the royal couple. But now another awakening is at hand, the Awakening of the True God.
