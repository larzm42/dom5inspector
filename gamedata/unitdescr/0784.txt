The Garmhird is an ancient band of sacred warriors. According to tradition they were once blessed by the Rimtursar with the ability to change shape into dire wolves. Today the name and their rage is the only remainder of the lost blessing of the Lords of Eternal Winter. They don heavy furs and fight with large battleaxes.
