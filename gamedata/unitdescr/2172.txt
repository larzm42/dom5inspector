Enkidus are large, hairy wild men with horns and unkempt hair. They live and frolic with the beasts of the wilderness and have only a vague notion of the concept of civilization. To most Enkidus civilization means Avvite slavers. With the founding of the First City, this has started to change and increasing numbers of the wild men are adopting the new ways of farming and metalworking.
