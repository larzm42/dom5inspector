The Yeti is a huge ape-like monster of the mountain glaciers. It sometimes attacks unwary travelers who try to cross the high mountain passes. Yetis are gifted with magical strength and are always surrounded by icy winds. The shamans of the yeti are quite adept at magic and should not be underestimated.
