The Tuatha are the rulers of Tir na n'Og, the Land of the Ever Young. They are descendants of the Nemedians who warred with the Fomorians in ancient times. The Tuatha arrived in the lands of the Fir Bolg, conquered them and turned to the lands of the Fomorian giants. They failed and when they returned to their Blessed Island they turned their energy toward crafts, poetry and magic. The Tuatha are sacred to the Fir Bolg and Sidhe inhabitants of the realm. In times of war they emerge from their Blessed Isle with their glamour and the magical armaments that let them conquer the numerically superior Fir Bolg.
