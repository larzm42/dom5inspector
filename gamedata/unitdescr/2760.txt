The Onaqui of Xibalba are demonic beings created by the Lords of Death to cause misery and suffering to the living. The oldest and most powerful of the Onaqui  sometimes emerge from the darkest caverns of Xibalba to wreak havoc upon men. Ahalgana is one of these ten Onaqui. He is the Jaundice demon, who causes bodies to fester and swell. He often works with Ahalpuh, the Demon of Pus.
