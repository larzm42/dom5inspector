The priestly occupation in Arcoscephale is restricted to women. Aspiring priestesses are raised in monasteries far from city life. Their training includes the study of Nature magic. Upon reaching full sisterhood, a Priestess is permitted to leave the monastery to serve at a temple. The Priestesses of Arcoscephale are peaceful and join armies only to tend the sick and wounded, a work at which they are unsurpassed.
