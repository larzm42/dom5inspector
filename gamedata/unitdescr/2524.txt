The Releases Ones were once servants of three gods imprisoned underneath the earth in ancient times by a previous Pantokrator. Powerful magic has sealed their prisons for millennia. Their souls were imprisoned along with their bodies and could not escape to the underworld when they died. For millennia their spirits have remained trapped in their fossilizing bodies. The passage of time has turned their bodies to stone and their weapons of bronze have fossilized and merged with their bodies. They are hard as stone, but somewhat brittle.
