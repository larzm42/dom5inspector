Sporsnjall is a Vaetti. He is skilled and well known in the halls of the Wolfkin, but to the giants he is but another goblin. Sporsnjall has decided to show his allies that small allies are as useful as large ones. Sporsnjall rides a white wolf that is believed to be the offspring of Angerboda, Mother of Monsters.
