The Telkhine God-King was the ruler of the Telkhines, ancient spirits of the sea with powers to rival the titans. They were masterful sages and metal crafters. They forged artifacts for the servants of the previous Pantokrator and taught the elder cyclopes their arts. But the Telkhines succumbed to hubris and made themselves god-kings to be worshiped by their subjects. When they discovered the means to create malefic poison through the mixing of stygian water and sulfur, their lands became poisonous to animals and plants alike. Their reign was put to an end by the Pantokrator and the entire kingdom was swallowed by the sea. The Telkhines themselves were imprisoned in Tartarus for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the mightiest of the Telkhines is breaking free. Telkhines are able to change their shape. In their demonic form they appear with dog heads and flippers instead of hands and their powers over storms and the sea are increased. In human shape their skills in forging are increased. Telkhines are always surrounded by stygian fumes that kills men and beast alike. Even the population in the province where they dwell will slowly suffer and die.
