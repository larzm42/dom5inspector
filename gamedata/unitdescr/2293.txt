Hyena is one of the most powerful of the totemic spirits. Hyena was called by Lion and the other spirits to bring the sun and the heat closer to the dark and cold lands of Machaka. But Hyena placed Sun closer to Earth than the other spirits intended and parts of the land became dry and inhospitable, much to the dismay of the other spirits. Hyena still laughs at their faces. Hyena taught metalcrafting to men and made Lion triumph over Rhino. All smiths follow Hyena. Hyena is also the end of all life. He devours the dead and feeds on unburied souls. The Boudas are his most trusted servants. The Bouda is a were-hyena, a shape-shifting sorcerer-smith of great power. In hyena shape he can mesmerize men with his glowing eyes and mocking voice. The Bouda is a cannibal who feeds on corpses or unwary lovers. The mere presence of a Bouda will upset the populace and cause unrest.
