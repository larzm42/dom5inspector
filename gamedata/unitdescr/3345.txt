The Wooden Colossus is a huge statue that has come to life from being worshiped for millennia. When the Pantokrator disappeared its aging wooden body became animate and people found new hope. The aging wood of the idol is brittle and it once lost its arm. The broken arm was quickly replaced by an arm of gold and the powers of the idol increased dramatically, probably due to increased following. The Wooden Colossus is mindless and mostly does what its worshipers believe it would do. It punishes harshly and rewards sparingly.
