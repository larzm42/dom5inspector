The Skratti is a user of dark magic. In ancient times, the Jotuns sacrificed blood to their ancestors, the Rimtursar. The Skrattir still practice the old ways and are feared by all. They avoid contact with lesser giants and focus on their goal of awakening the Rimtursar. Skrattis are able to change shape into huge wolves or werewolves.
