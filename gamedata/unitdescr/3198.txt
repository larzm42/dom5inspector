The Archousai are prominent priestesses and cult leaders of Arcoscephale. After years of service at a temple, skilled and influential Hiereiai might become cult leaders, Archousai. The Archousai rarely join armies, but as cult leaders they have some skills in leadership and command and bless the Heart Companions sacred band. The Archousai are unsurpassed healers. People from near and far come to seek their counsel, but with recent developments only those who serve the awakening lord are granted the gifts of the Archousai.
