The Daduchos, torch-bearer, is the leader of a mystery cult of the Closed Realm and officiant of the telesterion. When the Order of the Closed Realm was confined to the Palace of Pearls, many of the Daduchoi hid in the Closed Realm to avoid persecution by the Triton rulers. Now some of them have emerged to aid the Pelagian conquest of the Closed Realm, unknown to the rulers in the deeps. The Daduchoi are mystics of limited, but varied powers. They share a fascination for fire, the greatest secret of the Closed Realm. Daduchoi can only be recruited where there is a temple.
