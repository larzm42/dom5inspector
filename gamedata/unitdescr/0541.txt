The Wolf Kin of Jotun, or Vaettir, as they call themselves, are a tribal people of goblins living in the deep forests of Jotunheim. They try to avoid contact with the giants, but serve the Gygjas without question. The hags are sacred to the Wolf Kin and a Vaetti would gladly die to protect a Gygja in danger. The Wolf Kin wear heavy furs and some ride into battle mounted on their wolven friends. Vaettir are small and stealthy and can hide in enemy territories.
