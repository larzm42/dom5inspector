Old Bear Thunder is the last of the Perkunus, the Chud Thunder Priests of old. His face is wrinkled and his beard is white as snow. He remembers the time before the vanir arrived, when meat was eaten raw and the Sons of Heaven ruled from the Hall of Dawn. He has witnessed the Skinshifters' loss of grace and influence and bitterly resents the arrival of the vanir, who were responsible for the demise of his family. He now resides at the sacred Pine of Skulls awaiting the arrival of the awakening god, who will make the Chuds great again. Old Bear Thunder is a thunder priest of tremendous powers, but his grudge against the vanir has made him reclusive and asocial. Some claim that he has killed unsuspecting vanir and and fed them to his bear companion.
