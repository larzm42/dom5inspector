The warriors of Ulm are a superstitious lot, afraid of magic and spirits. Fear of the spirit world and its inhabitants influences everyday life in the wild forests. Shamans are able to communicate with spirits of the dead and the wild and guide the warrior tribes in spiritual matters. All shamans have some skill in Earth magic due to the spirits of the mountains and metals being the most important in Ulmic beliefs.
