Minotaur calves born with white hides are remarkably rare and such births are celebrated in Pangaea. These calves are given special care and trained with the White Centaurs. The birth of Menopathos was seen as an omen of great importance. Since his birth, Pangaea has begun the reconquest of the civilized world.
