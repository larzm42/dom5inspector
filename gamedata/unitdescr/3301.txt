The spiritual affairs of the Cynocephalians are mostly a matter of the women of the flock. Their shamans intoxicate themselves, dance and howl to gain insights into the spirit realm. They bless the hunt and seek the goodwill of the spirits. They have some skills in Nature magic and some of them practice other forms of magic. A few of them have adopted the bloody practices of Magog and the cannibal tribes.
