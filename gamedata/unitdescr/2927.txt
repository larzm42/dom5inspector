Dahut is the daughter of Malgven and Gradlon, founders of Ker-Ys. When Malgven returned to her ancestral home in the north all she left was her daughter and a Morvarc'h steed. When Gradlon died of old age the reign of Dahut began and Ker-Ys became a city of unrivaled splendor, enchanted by the sorcery of Dahut. But the golden age of Ys had to end. Tir na n'Og fell with the arrival of men and contacts with Ys were lost. When the last of the Tuatha kings was slain by a milesian hero the remaining Tuatha sorceresses fled the human onslaught. The refugees were invited by Dahut to come to the island city of Ys. Together they worked powerful magic and hid the city underneath the waves. Now a God has arisen with a promise of a new golden era, and the enchantments hiding the city have been unraveled. Ker-Ys and its queen has risen from the waves for all to witness.
