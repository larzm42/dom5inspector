The minotaur is a large, wild creature with the head of a bull, the upper body of a very muscular man and hindquarters of a hoofed being. Minotaurs are immensely strong and much faster than humans. They also have thick leathery hides that protect them from light injuries. Minotaurs revel in battle and almost never rout. They are large and wild enough to ignore smaller wounds and can trample men and smaller beasts. Minotaurs will become enraged and go berserk at the sight of their own blood. Minotaur warriors wear leather armor and use battle axes to fight beings larger than humans.
