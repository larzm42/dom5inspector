The Morgen Princess is a descendant of Dahut, queen of Ys. While younger and not as magically powerful as the sorceresses the princesses have become the true leaders of the queendom. Trained in tactics, magic and combat they have become mage-generals of unsurpassed skill. The Morgen Princesses lead the armies of Ys and the Morvarc'h Knights in the conquest of lands once theirs, and lands never visited.
