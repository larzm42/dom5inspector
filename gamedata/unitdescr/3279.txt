Spiritual affairs of the Cynocephalians are mostly a matter of the women of the flock. Their shamans intoxicate themselves, dance and howl to gain insights into the spirit realm. They bless the hunt and seek the goodwill of the spirits. Most of them have some skills in nature magic, but a few of them practice other forms of magic.
