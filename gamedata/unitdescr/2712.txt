Keshvar is a Caelian High Seraph and a great sage. He has dedicated his life to historical studies of the civil war and the downfall of the Eagle Kings. During his studies he realized that there was a powerful Caelian colony in the distant mountain range of Nazca that most likely had survived. Since his kin were afraid of the Harab Seraphs he decided to investigate the matter before revealing what he had found. He traveled to Nazca where he found a kingdom that was what Caelum should have been, a kingdom ruled by Eagle Kings, with all Caelian tribes united. Keshvar was delighted, but also afraid. He realized that if the Seraphs found out it was likely that they would renew the civil war and attack the blessed kingdom. He decided that he would aid the Sun Kings and prepare them for the eventual arrival of the Caelian Seraphs. He approached the Incas and the Priests and was accepted as a scholar and a diplomat. Keshvar is now one of the most trusted and knowledgeable mages of the Incas and the Hanan moiety. The Hurin Priests on the other hand, remembering the civil war, are suspicious and try to circumvent his influence in the Sun Court.
