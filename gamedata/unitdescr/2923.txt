Most of the inhabitants of Ker-Ys are Merrow, a strange breed of merfolk that resemble ugly, fish-eyed, green-skinned men with webbed fingers and green hair. Merrow have no problems leaving the sea, but they prefer the comfort of the waves. In ancient times they made contact with human and Fir Bolg settlements. With time they allied themselves with Tir na n'Og and Tuatha sorceresses made their way into the sea to study and guide the Merrow and their druids. Ker-Ys was founded and the Merrow gained influence in the underwater realms. When Tir na n'Og fell the Merrow lost their power and Ker-Ys became a refuge for the last of the Tuatha. Now, when the sunken city has reemerged from the waves, the Merrow follow their Morgen rulers in conquest of the underwater realms. The Merrow of Ys have mastered metal-working skills unknown to other Merrow and Ysian Soldiers and Men at Arms fight with armaments made of bronze.
