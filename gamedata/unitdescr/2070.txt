Sabba is woman of prodigal longevity. She claims to be the last of the Avvite wives of the Grigori of primordial times. Taught the arts of divination and healing by Semyaza himself, she has turned up from time to time to aid the meek. Her gentle soul could not stand the depravity and appetites of the Rephaim and only with the arrival of mankind did she leave her sequestration to give advice and guidance. It is thought by some that she taught the Sibyls and priestesses of Arcoscephale their skills, before mankind became numerous in the land of Gath. Sabba is a most accomplished diviner and healer.
