The Limitanei, frontier soldiers, guard the frontier from the enemies of the Empire. The lorica segmentata of earlier times has been replaced by heavier armor and the short gladius is replaced by the spatha. The Limitanei are drilled mainly for defense and are quite slow when on the march. However, they are good at defending forts. Most Limitanei come from the local populace and are given less pay than the soldiers of the Empire proper. Life on the Limes is often hard. Uncomfortable army camps, exposure to weather and remoteness of location contribute to the lack of morale among the Limitanei.
