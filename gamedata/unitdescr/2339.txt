Shadows are the spiritual remains of deceased humans that have become lost in the Shade Lands between the Underworld and the land of the living. The Shade Lands have robbed them of their spiritual strength, but they are still stronger than the dispossessed spirits that never left the physical world. Their touch can paralyze living beings.
