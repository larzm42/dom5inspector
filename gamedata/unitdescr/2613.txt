The six great Daevas are divine demons and emanations of the Destructive Spirit. Each Daeva of the Heptad represents an aspect of their Lord, opposed to the Amesha Spentas of the Lord of Wisdom. Indra is the Daeva of Frozen Minds who makes the righteous unable to practice the truth. He is opposed to Asha Vahishta, Spenta of Fire and principle of truth. The mind-numbing will of Indra will decrease faith in the province where he dwells.
