During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Since then, most of them have disappeared or fallen into perpetual sleep, but if enough blood is sacrificed, they might well awaken and serve the Dark God of Ulm. Vampire counts can dominate human peasants, who become nearly mindless and serve their master as obediently as dogs.
