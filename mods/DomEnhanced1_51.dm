The Darkhad live here, guarding this area fiercely against intrusion by all others and thus protecting the resting place of the Khans. In battle they ride specially bred horses wearing headgear fashioned to mimic the stag, the creature of the underworld that takes spirits to their rest. Several tribes practice head binding or scarification to mark out the noble families, and in most tribes these families are ritually tattooed. The number and prominence of tattoos represent standing in society and often relate to the deeds of their owner. These tattoos can be awoken by a Shaman to provide protection and speed. The Darkhad and their task are sacred to the Tatars."

#descr "The Dorias are among the noblest families in the republic and claim descent from one of the Triton King of Pelagia. Most do not believe this tale to be literally true, but no one can deny their unusual talent for all things related to the sea and they have produced many great admirals and navigators.
Andrea is the current head of the family and the most respected admiral in Venedia, both for his exceptional military skills and because he is one of the few to have also been trained as navigator owing to his natural talent for the magic of the sea. In battle he wields his family's magical heirlooms and is as comfortable swimming below the waves as sailing above them."

#descr "Marco is Venedia's most famous traveller. As a boy he was fascinated by tales of the distant empire of T'ien C'hi and decided he would be the first Venedian to travel there. 
Though the journey through stormy seas and lands infested by bandits and wild beasts was dangerous, Marco was cunning and resourceful and eventually reached T'ien Chi.
There he was surprised to discover that the emperors of old had been replaced by barbarian kings, but he was treated as an honored guest and was able to learn much of the country's culture and customs. 
His greatest discovery however was another - while exploring the wilderness he came upon a hermit who revealed himself as one of the last Masters of the Five Elements. 
Impressed by Marco's desire for knowledge and not wanting the Way to be completely lost someday, the Master agreed to take Marco as his student.
Many years have passed since then and now Marco has returned to his homeland. His years as a traveller have taught him to move through all types of terrain without drawing unwanted attention and the tales of the many wonders he has seen will inspire researchers in the province."

#descr "Leonardo is a man of extraordinary ingenuity whose skill and knowledge in many differents fields earned him fame as the greatest inventor and scientist in Venedia and perhaps the whole world. As a researcher he made discoveries in astrology, anatomy, engineering, mathematics, alchemy and many more sciences both magical and mundane, and as craftsman and artist he created many wonders and masterpieces for his patrons.
Now he has accepted to serve the Church of the Awakening God with his formidable genius. 
Leonardo is not a greedy man and cares little for material wealth, being only interested in the advancement of science and craft, but his studies and experiments require generous funding - though it is a price any prince in Venedia would gladly pay for the chance to have a man of such talents at their service."

#descr "Povosqa are tribal shamen that commune with the spirits of the plants, the earth and the sky. Through the use of sacred medicine formed from highly magical plant extracts they receive visions that impart mystical knowledge. Often members of the tribe will turn to a Povosqa for aid and guidance when faced with ill health or ill fortune. Povosqa are sacred to the people of the mesa due to their connection to the land, however they are not priests and do not learn the sacred rituals. Through fasting and communing with the spirits they have become adept at surviving in harsh conditions. This Povosqa has survived a perilous Vision Quest and has gained prophetic powers and ritual knowledge from the ordeal."

Long ago the head of their tribe ventured to the underworld and took the daughter of a great Serpent Man elder as his wife. Now the descendants of the Snake are blessed with hardiness, scaly skin and resistance to poison. Each year they perform the sacred Tsu'tiki, or Snake Dance deep in their underground Kiva, lead by their Priests. Snake Priests are adept in the magic of nature and can handle poisonous serpents with impunity. In battle they paint their faces black, the colour of death. Whilst at a Kiva the Snake Priests can raise Sacred Snakes that will be sent against the enemies of the faith. Like all the people of the mesa, they have become adept at surviving in harsh conditions."

As they grew these children were found to have great skill in divining the future and calling forth rainfall, and so were trained in these arts by the Povosqa. Now all such children are sent to the Cliff Palace in the Sky City in Ongtupqa to join the Yaya, a sacred priesthood and bringers of rain to the parched lands. The Yaya are skilled in the magic of the heavens and lead the great ceremonial dances calling forth the rain each year. Their fair skin leaves them vulnerable to harsh conditions and they are not as hardy as most people of the mesa."

It was Masauwu who helped settle the Chaco in the Fourth World and gave them stewardship over the land. When they emerged from the Underworld Masauwu granted them four sacred tablets, however the last was missing a corner.

Nequatewa knew this was Masauwu, the Skeleton Man and he was afraid. Masauwu told the priest how the people first emerged from the Underworld and were granted four sacred tablets, however the fourth was missing a corner piece. This was taken by the White Brother who travelled East and out of the realm of men. Soon, Masauwu intoned, the White Brother would return clothed in Red and sweep away all evil in a tide of fire. Since this meeting Nequatewa has fashioned a horrible mask and dedicated himself to the worship of Masauwu, preaching the imminent return of the White Brother.

He was granted a long life to see out his task and given a piece of the sacred tablet to identify himself upon his return. For long centuries Pahana has journeyed across the world and has seen the evils and iniquities it holds. Eventually he could stand it no more and journeyed back to his home land. There he found his people in a struggle against foreign invaders. Pahana appeared before them clothed in red and bearing the sacred tablet piece. He explained that the world was filled with evil and a new God was awakening that would bring a cleansing tide of fire. The followers of the True God would burn the invaders and their allies lands and new life would spring from the ashes. Soon the word spread, and people across the land now rally to the banner of the cleansing flame. Pahana has learnt much of magic and the world through his long journey. He is revered as the voice of the Awakening God and his word is law."

When the pale invaders arrived some rejoiced, thinking the Lost White Brother had returned. It was the elders that advised caution and insisted on testing the divinity of the newcomers. Now, with the return of the true Lost White Brother those elders with experience of battle are massing the people for the cleansing war."

Povosqa are sacred to the people of the mesa due to their connection to the land, however they are not priests and do not learn the sacred rituals. Through fasting and communing with the spirits they have become adept at surviving in harsh conditions.

Researching ancient texts brought from the lands across the sea he has unearthed foul rituals unknown to his brethren. Through these he has gained great power, however they were not meant for mortals to perform and without the divine blood of the Rephaim in his veins his mind has not survived entirely intact. Ashteroth is now amongst the most powerful of the Kings of the Starnake, however he demands ever greater quantities of captives for his table. His subjects fear that their King has become mad with blood and power and some now plot to remove him permanently."

-- Apparently mi dred does not mean 'terrible ones' or 'ferocious people,' but 'man-bears.'  In fact, 'mi-dred' is pretty much an alternate spelling of 'Yeh-teh' -- the Wylie romanization of 'yeti' is 'ya dred'. The ZYPY (Tibetan pinyin, the more accurate official way) would be 'michê', which is pronounced pretty much like mi dred. Being pedantic about mythology can be fun, but being pedantic about language only pleases linguistic purists and annoys everyone else. I'll leave it in the Wylie form, since "mi dred" resonates to us better than 'michê', and that's what people are used to it as. But yetis, on the other hand, become Yeh-teh.

#descr "Among the peaceful Mi Gö, warfare is seen as a task that burdens the soul with anger, fear and regret, and which consequently pollutes the soul and prevents spiritual attunement. The Mi Dred, which means 'man bear', are the sacred defenders of the Mi Gö. They are a sect of warrior-monks who seek to embody the animal purity and ferocity of the Yeh-teh, while learning to make war in a way that does not taint their spirits. They wield cudgels made of enchanted ice that resemble huge icicles. Those struck by these cudgels are frozen by the cold of the high mountains. They often settle near Bhödpa settlements built in suitably cold regions."

In the mountains of Bhöd where the rocky ground and scarcity of timber make burial difficult, the dead are disposed of by cutting them into small pieces and leaving them exposed to birds and the elements, a practice called bya gtor, or sky burial. Ragyapa are priests that perform the duties of disposing of corpses and dismembering them. Their duties give them some insight into rituals of death and of the air."

In times of peace, the oxen are used as pack and traction animals. In times of war, the wealthiest and most accomplished Bhödpa warriors train these hardy beasts as fighting mounts, riding them into battle with lance and bow. Yaks can be fierce animals, able to easily kill lightly-armored men by charging and goring them, and will often continue to fight even if their rider has been killed. Yak Riders can only be recruited in cold provinces."

-- Apparently mi dred does not mean 'terrible ones' or 'ferocious people,' but 'man-bears.'  In fact, 'mi-dred' is pretty much an alternate spelling of 'Yeh-teh' -- the Wylie romanization of 'yeti' is 'ya dred'. The ZYPY (Tibetan pinyin, the more accurate official way) would be 'michê', which is pronounced pretty much like mi dred. Being pedantic about mythology can be fun, but being pedantic about language only pleases linguistic purists and annoys everyone else. I'll leave it in the Wylie form, since "mi dred" resonates to us better than 'michê', and that's what people are used to it as. But yetis, on the other hand, become Yeh-teh.

#descr "Among the peaceful Mi Gö, warfare is seen as a task that burdens the soul with anger, fear and regret, and which consequently pollutes the soul and prevents spiritual attunement. The Mi Dred, which means 'man bear', are the sacred defenders of the Mi Gö. They are a sect of warrior-monks who seek to embody the animal purity and ferocity of the Yeh-teh, while learning to make war in a way that does not taint their spirits. They wield cudgels made of enchanted ice that resemble huge icicles. Those struck by these cudgels are frozen by the cold of the high mountains. It is said that these weapons were once far more common, but now only the Mi Dred are entrusted with carrying them."

His authority is substantial, but, in practice, it is rather limited and extends only to mundane matters; indeed, in matters of interest to the clergy (which is to say most matters of political importance), Jé defer to the Gelug, the spokesmen for the Hidden Masters. Invested with sacred status by the Hidden Masters, Jé are revered by their troops, and their mere presence inspires soldiers to great deeds of bravery."

Shambhalans, on the other hand, believe in reincarnation and regard corpses as empty vessels, and thus find no need to preserve the body. In the mountains of Shambhala where the rocky ground and scarcity of timber make burial difficult, the dead are disposed of by cutting them into small pieces and leaving them exposed to birds and the elements, a practice called bya gtor, or sky burial. Ragyapa are priests that perform the duties of disposing of corpses and dismembering them. Their duties give them some insight into rituals of death and of the air."

Many of them bind the angry demons and malevolent spirits of the mountains to harm those who offend them, and dabble in the devious ways of necromancy. Ngagspa are highly secretive and usually reluctant to share their knowledge. They care little for the new religion and its laws, and, if quietly recruited to the service of the ascendant god, their thinly-veiled heresy may encourage similar disrespect among those with whom they come into contact."

They are the religious and temporal supreme leaders of the nation, and represent the pinnacle of spiritual enlightenment in Shambhalan religion. Because of their high state of enlightenment, they have mastered their own metabolisms and have begun to transcend human needs; they live incredibly long, and need eat only once a month. They are masters of lung-gom-pa and levitation. Few mortals outside of Shambhala know about the Hidden Masters, and they can travel through enemy territories without being noticed.

#descr "The Yeh-teh of the frozen heights surrounding the Hidden Valley are giant, savage cousins of the Mi Gö, similar to the yeti of other mountain ranges but somewhat smaller, faster and more powerful. They are incredibly strong, able to dismember and quarter men with their bare hands with little effort, and have tough hides covered by thick white fur. They are strongest and most resilient in the coldest of places, and are so deeply bound to the cold that they radiate the icy chill of their mountains wherever they go. Known to the Bhödpa as Meteh Kangmi, the man-bears of the snow, Yeh-yeh have always been considered sacred by the tribesmen of the mountains. The Wise Ones of the Mi Gö know of ancient rituals to summon and bind Yeh-teh to service."

They appear as black-skinned demons with hideous bone necklaces. They are master archers, and when in one of their vengeful rages they range through the forests, killing anything that moves with their plague-ridden arrows. Sometimes, a Mu Bön Ngagspa sorcerer summons a vengeful Tsen with blood sacrifice and sends them against an enemy. Tsen bring death, and one struck by an arrow from their foul bow will almost surely die of disease."

Revered as patron spirits by Bhödpa smiths before the coming of the Hidden Masters, they carry huge hammers and have knowledge of the magic of earth and sky. Some know also of fire or dark magics. Though Theurang are not generally malevolent, they are resentful and mischievous creatures and may attack humans without real reason. Though they are sometimes mistaken for demons by superstitious Shambhalans because of their terrible countenance, Theurang are actually spirits of the land and belong to the hierarchy of Lha spirits."

The Sungma Lha are very skilled smiths, and have taught humans to work tempered steel when it suited them.

#descr "The Bodhisattva of Keen Awareness is a being of semi-divine origin who has achieved such a state of spiritual enlightenment that he has transcended his own mortality and all mortal needs. With the old Pantokrator alive, he could not ascend to true godhood and complete his enlightenment, and he retired to a secret place to meditate. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Bodhisattva is ready to resume his quest for ascension and to bring hope and solace to mankind. Though he is not physically as powerful as many other divine beings, the Bodhisattva has a strong dominion and is a powerful Astral mage because of his spiritual perfection. Furthermore, his aspect is such that few would dare to strike him, and his mere presence instills serenity in the hearts of mortals. In one hand he bears the sword of truth, which cuts through falsehood and destroys ignorance, and in the other he holds the stem of a lotus flower upon which is written a book on the attainment of trascendent wisdom."

With the Pantokrator gone, he now comes to throw that very hat into the ring in his bid for complete divinity. The Lama of the Frozen Heights is a highly-skilled mage, and is nearly immortal within his Dominion.

#descr "A shaman is a mage that contacts the spirit world to perform magic. The shamans of Gondwana perform rhythmic songs and dances that allow them to enter a powerful trance state for ritual casting. These dances can last for many hours and are accompanied by specially trained Spirit Dancers. Each shaman crafts a mask that grants them a closer affinity with the spirit world when worn, and crafting a mask is an important step in the training of a young shaman. Shamans are able to communicate with spirits of the air, the dead and the wild and guide the nation in spiritual matters."

#descr "Ohen is a master artificer that is known for crafting the finest weapons and armor in Gondwana. After the destruction of Machaka by the Irami zealots Ohen and the other remaining inhabitants fled into the safety of the God Forest. After long months, during which many were lost to starvation, disease and the horrors that lurked in the deep forest, they finally found a place of sanctuary. A land of rolling plains and giant beasts hidden away from the world. Welcomed by the rulers of this new land for the skills and knowledge they brought they now call Gondwana their home. Amongst the secrets they carried was that of working iron plate, once used to clad the hoplites of Machaka. Now the Machakan refugees forge weapons and armor for the Obas to equip their armies. Ohen is reknowned as the finest of the metalworkers and his skills are highly sought after."

The Sky is the great father, and the one who first breathed life into man. The Deep is the lord of darkness and magic, whispering secrets both wonderful and terrible. The White is the lord of abundance and agriculture, and keeps the peace. The Moon is the lord of war, and represents both the prosperity and horror that follows battles. The priests who follow them are trained to memorize special invocations to protect the warriors of Sawaiiki. However, their religious duties often prevent them researching effectively."

The sails of his ship made the priests and kahunas mistake him for an envoy of the White and they advised the people not to attack. But seeing the natives below him, he fought with them before becoming captured himself. When challenged to a duel for honor, he easily defeated the Ali'i Aimoku, thinking that it would be the end for him regardless. However, both the Ali'i and Maka'aina praised him, for only by blood can mana be transferred. Now the Explorer has become deified as an aspect of the White, and leads the people of Sawaiiki onwards."

But he grew arrogant, dissatisfied with his lot, and sought to make children that would rival his master's creation. He set the desert wind aflame, imbuing it with his power, and from it wove the Jinn to life. He made the Marids, first among the Jinn, regal and mighty. Then, from what fire remained, he made the Ifrits, proud and scheming; the Shayatin, devout and unfaltering; the Jann, devious and inquisitive. Finally, from the smouldering ashes he made the Ghuls, ravenous and cruel and without number, as the last of his creation. 
The Pantokrator beheld this slight, and called Iblis sinner, and banished him to where the light of the world does not shine. For centuries he has remained trapped in this eternal prison, letting his hatred stew, plotting his revenge on the world that failed him. Now, he has returned to command the armies of his children. His power rivals that of the pretender gods, and faith falters wherever he makes himself known."

#descr "The Ghazi tribes are the original inhabitants of the Juherani desert, whose descendants founded the city of Iram. They are a nomadic people adept at roaming the wastes, for there is no place to graze their herds for any length of time. Their lean existence means they often take to raiding and pillaging to secure supplies for their tribes. The city folk see them as warlike and uncivilised, though they share much of their culture and often trade or marry within the walls of the Brass City. Now the Awakening God has unified the city folk and the Ghazi tribes, and both ride to war together against the heathens from distant lands. The Ghazi Lancers charge enemy positions from the backs of their camels, using the weight of their mounts to punch through armor and flesh. Should the rider be killed, his camel may stay and fight on."

#descr "In ages past a great Goddess was born in which the power of femininity was embodied in one being. She could bear new life, heal the sick and see future events using divination. Soon after her creation the Pantokrator grew fearful and decided to divide the Goddess into three parts, to more safely contain her power. Each aspect of the Goddess was imprisoned separately to prevent their combined strength from overcoming his bonds. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the shackles are weakening and the Triple Goddess will soon return to guide her daughters once more. The Goddess now resides in three bodies, the Maiden, the Mother and the Crone. The Maiden is the promise of new beginnings and will cause living things to bloom and ripen. She skilled in the primal magic of Fire and Air. The Mother is the power of life and can heal sickness and disease. She is skilled in the hearty magic of Blood and Water. The Crone is the wisdom of age and can predict future events with great accuracy. She is skilled in the arcane magic of Astral and Death."

From its divine essence were created the Couatl, mythical serpent creatures that inhabit swamps and jungles. When the Pantokrator cut off the head of the Goddess he imprisoned her children for eternity, however now the Feathered Serpent has returned to claim the world. It can fly on the winds and is served by the Centzonmimixcoa, the Cloud Serpents."

Fearsome, cunning and patient it claims to be lord of all spiders and can strike from the darkness with strong webs and lethal poison. When people began to worship it hoping to be spared from its hunger the Pantokrator banished it to the outer darkness for eternity, where it would be condemned to weave its webs forever with no prey to catch. But now the Pantokrator is gone and the God Spider has returned to claim the world."

A hatch allows sacrifices to be placed inside, where they will be burnt to a crisp by the roaring furnace that burns in the belly of the bull. The screams of the sacrifices are channeled to create the bellowing of the demon bull and smoke pours from its mouth and nose. Over centuries the bull has demanded ever greater sacrifices to sate its hunger. Countless offerings later and now with the Pantokrator gone, the Brazen Bull has the chance of putting the world under its strong dominion and becoming the True God."

The sacred spirits of dead Rephaim can be summoned by the Ba'al from Sheol to serve him. Spectres are ethereal and able to enter the sea."

That time has come and he has awakened to lead Man as God-King. The Once and Future King is always accompanied by two Wardens of Avalon, and more will arrive as his dominion grows strong.
The blood of the Tuathas runs strong in his veins granting him innate magical powers."

Through superior craftsmanship the local province will be able to equip more soldiers each month. The Angel teaches men not to trust in magic and demonstrates the weakness of false faiths by stopping sacred beings in their tracks. Fanatical adherents of other faiths will find themselves awed, belittled and unable to strike it. The Blacksteel Angel never uses magic and his fist will strike unbelievers with utmost judgment. It is extremely resilient and will rarely suffer permanent injuries."

The people of Ulm worshipped it as a symbol of the power of human ingenuity and made it their own god and idol. In time it gained a semblance of will and began to move under its own power. The Colossus is extremely hard to destroy and, while slow, can tirelessly trample lesser foes. It is highly resilient and will suffer permanent injuries less often than most creatures."

#descr "At the beginning of time the Pantokrator created seven angelic beings from his own illumination. Foremost was the Peacock Angel, a being of light itself. Upon creating the first man from the dust of the earth the Pantokrator decreed all the angels must bow before it, however the Peacock Angel refused. He reasoned a being of light should not bow before a creature of the dust. At this the other angels cried out and called him a Devil and a Heretic. The Pantokrator however praised him for seeing the truth and bade him sit at the side of the Throne of Heaven. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the Peacock Angel will take his place and bestow blessings and misfortune as he sees fit. Anyone striking at his glory will in turn be struck by awe and blindness. In combat he can manifest gems of Water, Air and Nature magic to aid in spellcasting."

This being saw all that occurred, and reported to the Pantokrator each sin committed so that punishment could be assigned. Over time the being grew fond of the creatures over which it watched, and no longer wished to cause them pain and suffering. He took great golden bands and sealed them over his eyes, that he would not be able to see their sins. When the Pantokrator discovered such treachery he bound his servant below the earth for eternity. Now the shackles grow weaker and the Lord of Mysteries can return to the world he covets. He has three heads for watching the three realms, however the golden bands that block his sight cannot be removed. In combat the Lord of Mysteries will manifest gems of air, earth and death to aid in spellcasting."

He is strong in the magic of Death and is a righteous defender of the innocent. The Mother has powers of fertility and is the bearer of new life. She is strong in the magic of Nature and bears a mystic Ankh. The Father has Dominion over the heavens and knowledge of all things. He is strong in Astral Magic and wears a double crown to denote his lordly might. The Triad once governed human affairs, however following the rebellion of minor Gods the Pantokrator imprisoned all his servants to prevent further treachery. Now the Pantokrator has departed and the Triad can once more return to the world to claim the Throne of Heaven."

#descr "The Titan of the Night is a giant of divine heritage. She was born out of chaos in ancient times and claimed dominion over the night and darkness in all its forms. She gave birth to the Keres, the bloodthirsty daimones of the underworld, and rules them as their queen. In time even the Pantokrator grew fearful of her and bound her in a great cave at the entrance to Tartarus. With the Pantokrator gone it is rumoured she may have already broken her chains and stalks the world unseen. The Titan of the Night can become invisible at will, but sometimes appears as a gaunt winged figure robed in bloody garments. The Titan of the Night is more powerful in darkness and her touch can drain the life from the living. Each month her children will bring her slaves of pure blood, and in combat she will manifest a magic pearl and a death gem for use in spellcasting."

The Divine Egg is infused with the magic of new life, and around it living things will grow and heal at an amazing rate. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshipped as a reawakening god. The Egg cannot move, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Egg is tremendously strong in its dominion.

#descr "The Statue of the Outer Gods is the spirit of an alien God that inhabits an ancient statue of unknowable origin. Brought to this world by the starspawns, the statue is constructed of a strange greenish stone with unearthly flecks and striations. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can mentally control its followers in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion and it is also magically powerful. Mental emanations from the statue will attract strange creatures from the Void, as well as the weak willed as its dominion grows strong. The statue is deeply unsettling and although it cannot strike back in combat enemies may flee rather than face it."

#descr "After the death of the Prophet his remains were kept in the temple of the Holy City of Eldregate and venerated as relics while the nation awaited the coming of the mysteryous New God he had promised. Replicas of the shrouds he wore were made and used by his most devoted followers to heal the sick and wounded, and faithful from all around the Empire made pilgrimages to to Eldregate to offer prayers and sacrifices to the Prophet's tomb. As the focus of such devotion the Reliquary gained great spiritual power. One day as many followers of the New Faith were praying it suddenly began to shine with celestial light. More and stronger miracles manifested, and it was clear a powerful spirit had bound itself to the remains. The Bishops were quick to declare the New God they had been waiting for had awakened, and it was the Prophet himself who had ascended to the Celestial sphere after his death to wait for the time when the faith of the people would be strong enough to call him back to the world, and make him into the God he had promised.
Now Ermor follows the Second Coming of the Prophet, confident that he will lead the Empire to glory and dominion over the whole world."

#descr "In Eldregate, capital of the Empire, unholy rites were performed using dark magic learned from C'tis.
The goal was resurrect the Prophet, for many had come to believe that he would bring an age of wealth and prosperity where Ermor held ultimate dominion over the world.
However the ritual failed catastrophically: there was no resurrection but rather the spiritual barriers between the worlds of the dead and the living were shattered and Death was brought forth, killing tens of thousands. 
Now a powerful spirit of the Underworld is bound to the Prophet's tomb, turning the land to ash and desolation as its dominion spread.
The Unholy Reliquary is surrounded by a terrifying life-draining aura and because of its close connection to the Underworld generates two Death gems every month."

#fixedname "Hades"
#descr "Hades is a giant of divine heritage. Once given the task of ruling the dead by a previous Pantokrator the Titan was forbidden to enter the land of the living. Forever banished from the living world the Titan watched in envy as the living went about their business. He made his realm a dull and pale replica of the land under the sun. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Titan of the Underworld can return to the land of the living, with his gifts of death and darkness. Hades was once given a helmet of invisibility by the cyclops smiths of Tartarus. With the aid of this helmet he has occasionally entered the world of the living to observe and slay those who display hubris."

Sometimes it happens that an Olm survives for hundreds of years and grows both huge and intelligent. These Olms develop a deep connection to the waters and the earth in which they live and have some priestly powers amongst the Pale Ones. Olms communicate wordlessly and can project images and emotions to other sentient beings. Giant Olms can use this power to summon other Olms to the surface, and it can also be used to overwhelm and harm an enemy."

Though Zhong achieved top honours in the exams, his title was stripped by the emperor because of his disfigured appearance. In anger, Zhong Kui committed suicide upon the palace steps. During his judgement in the afterlife, the Hell King saw potential in Zhong. Intelligent enough to score top honours in the imperial examinations, but damned to hell because he committed suicide, the Hell King gave him the title King of Ghosts. He is tasked to forever hunt, capture, restrain and order evil spirits and in battle will summon a spirit each turn to aid him. Most undead creatures will bow before his authority and serve him rather than face him in battle."

In the catastrophe that caused the star to fall it fell into a deep death-slumber until the stars were right for it to live again. Few amongst the Starspawn know that K'llulu actually engineered the event that caused the star to fall in order to open up new worlds to conquer. Now awoken it will once more lead the Starspawn to absolute domination. K'llulu is a terrifying sight and many will falter at the mere sight of it. As a creature partially of the void it is a master of Astral magic and adept in the paths of Death and Water, and as High Priest its religious authority is absolute amongst the starspawn. The mind of K'llulu is strongly intertwined with the Void and its very presence will spread the Dominion of the Awakening God. As long as the stars remain right the creature cannot be truly destroyed and will reform in R'lyeh if killed, however if the stars are no longer right it will return to a restless torpor. Like all Illithids it is amphibious and can blast the minds of weaker beings."

Being dead their Divine Dances no longer have the power they once held, and their magic has been likewise tainted."

Quirinus has now been called back to the land of the living, and although dead still demands to be kept in a suitable manner. The Emperor has grown in magical power from his time in the Underworld and is a master of Death magic. He is highly skilled at reanimation and will raise more dead servants each month. He has religious authority and presides at official ceremonies in the great temple in the capital. As the first Emperor of Sceleria he demands to ride in a palanquin carried by slaves at all times and is protected by an honour guard in battle."

They are said to have been created by some nameless deed at the beginning of time and although possessed of great cunning they show no evidence of understanding or communicating with mortals. The Hounds appear as horrible ethereal creatures that manifest to snatch their prey back to the void with them, to be devoured at the Hound's leisure."

They live deep within the bowels of active volcanoes, amongst magma flows and the abandoned halls of lost civilizations. Ember Lords are masters of fire magic, and also have some skill in earth and death magics. In battle they fight with a magical flaming whip and incinerate their enemies with flames that pour from their gaping maw. Although Ember Lords have wings they can only fly for short distances, limiting their speed. If an Ember Lord's body is destroyed it will explode in a great conflagration before gradually reforming in the burning depths over the course of centuries."

If everything goes as expected, the clockwork soldier will use its sword to tear into the enemy ranks and its shield will whirl around in a random fashion to block enemy attacks. Fortunately, the springs and clockworks powering the soldier will only allow for a short burst of frantic attacks before they need to be wound up again."

She can also take the form of a large raven to pick the eyes from the dead, and is thus sometimes known as the 'Battle Crow'. She is known to cause fear and confusion among soldiers to move the tide of battle to her favour. She is often seen at the site of terrible battles and the Fir Bolg sometimes refer to a battlefield as 'The Garden of Badb'.

They must kill regularly, for if the blood staining their hats dries out they will quickly die. Redcaps are very fast in spite of the heavy iron pikes they wield and the iron-shod boots they wear."

Finally came hulking creatures with the bodies of men but with the heads and tails of great sharks.
Eventually Tiamat was cut asunder and her children scattered to the four corners of the earth. Now they reside in dark places from whence they can only be drawn with powerful magic.

Usually only wealthy nobles have the leisure time to devote themselves fully to such activities, and some even turn to studying dark arts to further indulge their forbidden urges. An outward veneer of respectability allows such individuals to travel unnoticed in foreign lands, however a province containing a Debauched Libertine will experience increased unrest as rumours of their activities reach the common folk.

Saddened by the sight of a lifeless land, he created the Amaru from water and light - rainbows - to spread life-giving rivers and streams throughout the land. Many of the Amaru combined the qualities of jaguar, bird and serpent.  The Amaru that created rivers and streams through the highlands connecting the mountains to the jungles took the form of winged jaguars with serpentine tails. Although most Amaru are not malevolent, they are not particularly fond of mortal beings. They are reputed to have hidden magical powers and the people of Nazca revere all Amaru."

It first created a great river filled with magnificent abundance and took pride in the results of its work. The pantokrator rewarded the Black Amaru with stewardship over the realm and a duty to protect its human inhabitants. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator the creature is barred from entering the mortal realm and can only be called through powerful magic. It is strong in the magic of the water, the earth and the starlight from which it was made. The people of Nazca revere the Black Amaru and it has great priestly powers."

Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught the secrets of war by their fathers and are formidable warriors. The Rephaim have gruesome appetites and many of them feast on the flesh of their smaller kin. They will devour food, beasts, men and kin and as long as there is population in a province, they do not starve, although the populace will suffer. They are much feared by the Avvim and Horim and are considered sacred. This Rephaite bears arms and armor that radiate heat from the forge of Azazel and has been granted the title of Dawn Warrior."

The body of the ancient angel is dead, but his willpower keeps it alive in a state of constant decay. In his undead state he has lost some of his power over Blood and his connection to the Earth, however he has gained in knowledge of Death.

With the Pantokrator gone, Kur can once more be summoned from his dark abode. Kur has control over the waters and the earth and can cause rocks of all sizes to attack opponents. He can breathe fire and will regenerate wounds with great speed, whilst his thick tail can crush the life from enemies. He is one of the three Underworld Guardians along with Kerberos and Hamartabal. Should all three be summoned from their post it is said the gates to the Underworld will be unguarded and the dead shall walk the earth."

Sauromancers from C'tis were invited by the Emperor and his Theurgs to battle the growing threat and with them came the Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult was heralded as the answer to the Ermorian threat and quickly received Imperial acceptance. Soon it replaced the Order of the Theurgs as the state cult and grew in influence and power. In the years that have passed since the lizards left Pythium, the Cult has changed. Serpents are venerated and the priests of the Cult wear serpent masks and carry serpent staffs as signs of their office. This Serpent Priest has taken the role of Bishop to lead the cult as the primary religion of the Empire."

#descr "The Picts are an isolated tribe that lives in the frigid corner of an ancient island near Marverni. Long ago they retreated to their isle and became creatures of myth and legend, appearing only rarely to raid far flung villages on nights of the full moon. The Picts adorn themselves with tattoos daubed in blue woad, a special paint made from sacred herbs that grow only on their island, and which they believe will grant them fortune in battle. The Picts are stealthy warriors, however in battle they succumb to bloodlust and are gripped with battle fury. The tattoos of the Picts must be awoken with magic. Pictish Chieftains are revered by the tribes of Marverni and have some priestly authority, in addition to rudimentary knowledge of the magic of the forest."

#descr "Serpent Priests are the leaders of the Pythian Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult is one of the many mystery cults that spread to Pythium during the collapse of Ermor. Sauromancers from C'tis were invited by the Emperor and his Theurgs to battle the growing threat and with them came the Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult was heralded as the answer to the Ermorian threat and quickly received Imperial acceptance. Soon it replaced the Order of the Theurgs as the state cult and grew in influence and power. In the years that have passed since the lizards left Pythium, the Cult has changed. Serpents are venerated and the priests of the Cult wear serpent masks and carry serpent staffs as signs of their office. This Serpent Priest aspires to become the Serpent Bishop and cement the Serpent Cult as the official state church."

The Cult of the Great Mother is very popular among women and most of the members in its higher ranks are female. The Epoptes is a high ranking member of the Cult of the Great Mother. The liturgy of the mystery cult is heavily influenced by the Arcoscephalean priestesses and their skill in healing. Like all mystics of the Empire, the Epoptes leads worshippers astray and lowers the Dominion in which she resides. She wears a garland and a green dress and carries an urn and a twig as signs of her office. The urn is enchanted and is always full of grain.

The Heliodromus, Sun-Courier, is the highest ranking member of the Cult of the Solar Bull. He, for it is only males that are allowed in the Cult, performs the Taurobolium, ritual sacrifice of a bull. The Heliodromus carries a golden sacrificial knife. Like all mystics of the Empire, the Heliodromus leads worshippers astray and lowers the Dominion in which he resides.

Appearing as great armoured figures bearing sacred relics, their divine wrath is terrible to behold. Once summoned they will fight against the enemies of the faith until such time as their services are no longer needed, returning from the celestial realm if slain within friendly Dominion.

Most wear heavy, crude armor made of leather, wood and bone, often adorned with feathers. Feather plumed helmets are worn by more prominent fighters. The most cunning hunters use blow pipes firing darts poisoned with brightly coloured frogs from the Miclan jungles. These hunters are experts at finding exposed flesh and even a scratch will lead to paralysis and sometimes death."

In the catastrophe that caused the star to fall it fell into a deep death-slumber until the stars were right for it to live again. Few amongst the Starspawn know that K'llulu actually engineered the event that caused the star to fall in order to open up new worlds to conquer. Now awoken it will once more lead the Starspawn to absolute domination. K'llulu is a terrifying sight and many will falter at the mere sight of it. As a creature partially of the void it is a master of Astral magic and adept in the paths of Death and Water, and as High Priest its religious authority is absolute amongst the starspawn. The mind of K'llulu is strongly intertwined with the Void and its very presence will spread the Dominion of the Awakening God. As long as the stars remain right the creature cannot be truly destroyed and will reform in R'lyeh if killed, however if the stars are no longer right it will return to a restless torpor. Like all Illithids it is amphibious and can blast the minds of weaker beings."

#descr "In the final battle for Rotterlands freedom Ostlem was besieged for three long years. The city was bombarded with fire and lightning until only the walls still stood. Ostlem's defenders endured, supplied only by sea. Finally, the last line of defense gave and Marignese pikemen surged over the walls. Then the gate of the dike was opened, and an army of mermen flooded through the breach. The Pelagian princess, who had once brought disaster on Rotterland, now returned as leader of her diminished people to save it. Only the skilled and lucky survived the siege, and through necessity the defenders of Ostlem became talented marksmen. Now they use powerful arbalests that can kill an armoured knight at a hundred paces. A Marksman Captain will count as 10 regular soldiers when defending a fortress during a siege. Like all inhabitants of Rotterland they are used to living in the flooded lands and are resistant to diseases."

Standing nearly a head taller than most men, Benkei had mastered the martial arts by his seventeenth year. Leaving his master's temple he wandered the land, challenging those he met to duels. After winning over nine hundred duels he was finally bested by a mysterious stranger and swore to aid his victor. The stranger was revealed to be a Nu Kua in service of the Dragon Kings, and took Benkei to the Dragon Court where he now aids the servants of the Dragon Kings. Benkei is a master of many fighting styles and enchanted tattoos cover most of his body. He was taught the art of bone setting by the Kappa and is able to recover from grievous injuries."

The spirit cannot leave the Pillar, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the stone pillar would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."

When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his power and the Great White Stag was forever imprisoned. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Great White Stag has returned once more to claim dominance over the world. The Stag is a majestic creature of great power and beauty and many enemies will hesitate to strike it in battle."

Nevertheless, they set out on a long and arduous journey to the East Mountain. When the boys arrived, they found that their father was none other than Sun God himself. Sun God subjected the two young men to many deadly trials to determine whether they were truly his sons, but they passed each one. Accepting him as his children, he offered them jewels, livestock, game, plants, and beautiful flowers, but each time they refused. Instead they asked for weapons and armor to defeat the rampaging monsters that were terrorizing the First People. Sun God agreed and placed agate within them, making them immune to injury, and gave them weapons and armor forged from divine jet. Naayéé Neizghání was given black jet axes and arrows, granting him the blessing of lightning. A storm rages whenever Naayéé Neizghání is driven to anger, and zigzag lightning strikes wherever he lands his blows. With the coming of the New God, Naayéé Neizghání has returned to once again take up the title of Monster Slayer."

His tactical genius and leadership allowed him to scatter the Marverni war-leaders, and the fertility of their land made him wealthy. Caesar was very impressed by the valor of the Marverni Eponi tribe, and he used his considerable charisma to win the service of an entire legion of these proud horsemen."

After Da Yu's father was imprisoned by the furious chieftain his young son was ordered to complete the task. Da Yu travelled across the flooding land and through great skill and effort oversaw the construction of a new watercourse that guided the waters into the ocean. Da Yu has gained great power of earth and water during his long quest and was rewarded with immortality by the Celestial powers for his achievement."

One day long ago ten disobedient Sun birds broke the rule of the Celestial Magistrate and flew to the earthly realm. The heat given out by the birds scorched the people of the world and set their crops aflame. Hou Yi, a well known archer, was enraged and vowed to protect his village. With his bow he downed nine of the Sun birds and forced the last to fly back to the Celestial realm. To award his meritorious service an official of the Celestial court granted him power and immortality, on the condition he continued to protect the people of the world. Hou Yi wields a great golden bow and his shots often strike the hearts of his targets."

One day he couldn't stand to be shackled by the ground any longer and left his duty as a Temple Guard to find a way to fly. He left Caelum for ten years, and eventually everyone believed him to be dead. Now, however, he has returned on the back of the great Eagle King himself. The 'Storm Knight,' as he is now known, has become stronger and more skilled during his travels and returns to Caelum a fierce warrior. His noble friend, the Eagle King, can fly even in the fiercest storms and his shriek will bring fear to their foes. Although the Storm Knight is widely considered to be a hero in Caelum, he still feels guilty for betraying his sacred duty, and now serves the awakening god to cleanse his soul."

The hatred of the greatest eagle is terrible to behold, his shrieks of sorrow draining the courage out of any soldier. He also wields the ancient symbol of his royal power, the Amulet of Storms, which allows him to fly during the fiercest storms and protects him from harm."

Angerboda taught her sorcery before banishing her from the Iron Woods. She travelled far and wide until she reached Gnipahålan, the place where the dead pass. There she used her power in death magic and became the queen of that dark place. She holds feasts for the passing dead and many mortals have come to her to plead for her to release one of her guests back to life. None have had anything worthwhile to offer to this dark queen, so she has just laughed at their requests. Now she has decided to serve the awakening god so that she could be rewarded with power over all of the dead, not just those who pass through Gnipahålan. The Sorceress of Hel is always accompanied by a host of undead in battle."

He loves to play seemingly random tricks and pranks on those around him. But beneath his trickery lies a sinister plan, for he has been prophesied to play a great part in the war of gods. The pantokrator imprisoned him with poison, but now he has escaped and come to serve the awakening god to fulfill his destiny. The Trickster is a skilled sorcerer and a master of illusions. He can spread chaos and confusion amongst the enemy ranks. However, his mischievous pranks will cause unrest in the province where he resides."

He wields a mighty weapon called Brahmastra that can transform itself into divine weapons. When in the shape of a bow, Brahmastra is a fierce weapon that will kill several solders with one bolt and can destroy city walls. The great hero Hanuman gave him a magical arrow that will slay anyone with a mere scratch. Though Rama prefers to use it as a bow, he can use the morphing blade in several forms simultaneously in melee. Rama is known as a kind spirit that does not anger easily. He has recently been in self-imposed exile deep in the forests of Kailasa, meditating on the coming ascension wars. He has come to the conclusion that the use of force is justified and has come to offer his might into the service of the awakening god."

#descr "Wielding pearl weapons is a sign of great status in Pelagia. They are a relatively new invention, masterminded by the legendary Xi Akloz, the Pearlsmith. It was his idea to use magical astral fire, the only fire that burns underwater, to retain the full magical power of the pearls while forging. He shared his secrets with other Pearl Kings and soon astral fires blazed in the forges of Pelagia. He is widely respected, but likes to spend his time in solitude, forging pearl equipment and taking care of his clam fields. Recently his clam fields were attacked by a horde of kraken, and they are now forever spoiled. Although he feels the toll of many centuries on his shoulders, he has decided to serve the awakening god, who he hopes will purge the seas of the monsters of the deep."

This hippocampus was found and befriended by an ambitious Triton Prince, who has now risen in the ranks of Triton nobility like a shooting star. While patrolling the border, he saved the legendary Lord of Pearls from a horde of sea trolls and was gifted with magical pearl armaments.

The stallion is a massive, frightening beast whose hooves can mangle several soldiers at once. It has been prophesized that he will conquer many kingdoms and bring a new era of prosperity for Arcoscephale. There are many legends of his ancestry, and many say that he is of divine heritage - a son of a god.

#descr "Nikolaos is a humble and pious bishop. He travels the land to help the poor, give hope to the desperate, and expose the villains. He is famous for the numerous divine miracles that happen around him. Once, when a butcher tried to sell human meat to the poor, Nikolaos saw through the crime and resurrected the victim with his prayers. On another occasion, during a great famine he convinced sailors to give the Emperor's food shipment to the needy. When the sailors arrived at the Imperial Palace, ready to receive a punishment, they found out their shipment was even bigger than before their act of charity. He also encountered a father of three girls, who was too poor to give them dowry and feared them being forced to go to the streets. Seeing that, Nikolaos stealthily entered the house and put a purse of gold coins in the stockings of each of the three daughters. While still a simple bishop, his reputation and piousness make him a popular hero and give him an importance in the church that belies his title."

He was taught how to win every battle and how to awaken the fury inside him. After he had spent a couple of years under the tutelage of Scathach, Cu Chulainn arrived. The two became friends and foster brothers, but Scathach prophesied that Ferdiad would fall before the spear of his brother.

#descr "In the deep swamps of Mictlan live a tribe of Atlanteans called the toad tribe. Many of them are refugees from the wars raging under the waves that have chosen to make a living on the land, far away from the horrors of the sea. The toad tribe are led by shamans, Atlanteans who studied magic under the sea. The toad tribe has recently began trading with the Mictlan people who are impressed by their skill in water magic. Some of the more skilled shamans have been ordained as low-ranking priests of Rain. Now one of the priests has come to serve the awakening god to further improve ties between the refugee Atlanteans and the people of Mictlan. Each Toad Priest can lead a handful of men underwater and is protected by a small host of Toad Tribe warriors."

Sigurd found many magical armaments in the dragon's hoard, including a magical cloak that makes him invisible and allows him to sneak into enemy territory. After killing Fafnir, Sigurd bathed in the dragon's blood which has made him invulnerable to normal weapons.

Many came to visit Laurin and to see his beautiful garden. But one day an oafish adventurer and his squire came to the garden and trampled all over it. Laurin tried to stop them but was wrestled to the ground. He was humiliated. Enraged, Laurin has now come to serve the awakening god hoping that the new god will lead him to his revenge. The Keeper of the Rose Garden is now prepared for battle and has adorned a magical belt that grants him giant's strength. He will break one bone for each rose trampled once he gets his hands on those adventurers. His garden is gone but he can draw upon its memory and produce some temporary nature gems in each battle."

Since then, he knew that there is beauty in death and would not rest until he had achieved the same kind of perfection.

Now his life's work is complete and he is the master of the Dance of Blades. Few foes can now stand against him, and even fewer can land a blow through his shield of blades.

The 'Black Terror' as he was once known, is not at all pleased with his new body, but tries to make the best of it, relying on quickness and precision over strength and resilience. Many bandar are repulsed by the sight of a Markata carrying swords, but those who openly oppose this strange Markata have an odd habit of being found dead the following day. He has managed to coerce a Guru to forge gear for him, and has regained some of his past demonic traits. He now serves the awakening god, hoping to have his old body returned in exchange for his loyal service."

#descr "Tizimin is a Chilan who specializes in prophecies. When the flood came, the water stopped at the entrance of his house, and he welcomed the new rulers of Xibalba. He is well known for his magnum opus, the Chilan Balam. It is a collection of Xibalban histories, prophecies and the mystical knowledge of a lifetime, which he lends to those in need. He is very difficult for most of his peers to understand and has a hard time contributing to research without his book. The sacred rituals and arcane revelations in his book grant him an enhanced religious authority."

He also lusted for fame and was envious of his rival consul Pompey and his military success. Seeking fame, Scassius led an ill-fated campaign against Pangaea and got his army slaughtered in a forest ambush. Scassius tried to flee, but his mercenaries were furious at his cowardice and captured him. They filled his throat with molten gold to mock him and sent his decapitated head to Sceleria, where it was used as a prop in plays mocking Scassius. The cursed consul’s soul has broken the cycle of death and rebirth and he has appeared as an apparition of greed and hatred. Gold coins constantly drip from his mouth and any living creature that he touches is turned to gold."

#descr "Juan Bruns is one of the first men to brave the sea and leave Marignon by sail. These brave men who explored over the horizon were called Conquistadors and were widely respected in Marignon. Many of these explorers perished to famine, disease, fickle seas, or the spears of the natives. In fact, Juan is the last known Conquistador and he has lived to a very respectable age. Some say that this is due to his knowledge of magic while others say that he had found the fabled fountain of youth in the strange lands across the sea. He is known to not care much for politics or the fancy uniforms of the Admirals and Navigators. Now he has returned from a grand expedition and the legendary hero has chosen to serve the awakening god. Juan has taken in some odd practices from the foreign lands, and his example might lead some people away from the worship of the awakening god. Juan is still an adventurer at heart and hates to waste time in the lab researching or casting rituals. He never stops recruiting mercenaries for his adventures, to whom he promises riches and fame."

All of them are surviving Knights of the Chalice from the final battle fought against the hordes of Ermor. They were tasked with guarding the holy artifact and were also allowed to drink from it, guarding them from the ravages of time and healing their afflictions. They wield blades tempered in sacred flames which will spread holy fire in battle. During the centuries of their watch, the Guardians of the Chalice have also trained in the arts of magic by studying tomes left by the Grand Masters of old. They have completely isolated themselves from the demon summoning masters and are untouched by the practice of blood magic. The order has now seen fit to release one from their ranks to serve the awakening god."

However, the Barbarian Kings were remarkably tolerant of the monks and allowed them to continue their religious practices. Phagpa saw that this arrangement was preferable to destruction by the unruly warriors and began to work closely with the invaders. Soon he ingratiated himself with a young noble named Kubadei, and when this noble ascended the throne of T'ien Ch'i Phagpa was rewarded with the title of Imperial Preceptor of the land of Shambhala. Phagpa is the highest ranking monk in the empire and acts as liaison between the Barbarians and the people. He has so far managed to keep the culture and practices of his homeland relatively unchanged. With the awakening of a new God he works to syncretise the beliefs of the two peoples and ensure harmony between the disparate elements of the empire he calls home."

He was taught the magic that comes naturally to his kind and the priestly rituals of the new cult.

In their desperation they gathered at the ruins of the Citadel of the Frozen Crystal to weep for beauty that was lost. But they were not alone, for the Harab Seraphs had placed a Raptor scout named Varesruva to spy upon the Ice Crafters. As the Varesruva gazed upon the ruins of the icy palace, he saw a vision of the place as it once was. He was awed and showed himself to the last crafters, begging them to teach him their art. Varesruva proved to be a quick student and the crafters passed their secrets onto him. His masters are now gone, but Varesruva keeps their art alive."

His years at the arena and the cursed shackles have corrupted his body and soul, but he has managed to regain some of his spiritual connection with wild nature. If wounded, his dark memories from the Arena will take over him, sending him into a berserk rage. Now Katidata serves the awakening god, hoping to cleanse his body and soul. He still wears his cursed shackles, but he has learned to use the chain as a weapon. His corruption has made him able to use blood magic and he secretly collects a monthly tribute from barbaric human tribes of the jungle, who are intimidated by his primal might."

All people who saw him knew of his great sin from this mark and chased him away. Cain was doomed to wander through creation all alone and to never find peace. He is immortal and he can find no one to end his misery, for the Pantokrator ordained that all harm to him will be avenged sevenfold. The Kinslayer has been wandering for aeons and has learned sorcery to contact magical creatures both fair and foul to end his misery, but to no avail. The awakening god of Gath is his last hope. His curse has weakened with the disappearance of the Pantokrator, but his presence will still kill some of the local population due to famine."

It was decided that the land within the range of a bow shot would be given to the Airyas, and the remainder would be kept by the Turans. In order to secure enough fields for the Airyas, Arash, with the help of the Amesha Spenta, built an exceptionally strong bow. When he fired it, the arrow flew above Lake Urmia, and landed at the roots of the mountain of the Everburning Caverns, giving to the Airyas a territory so vast that a man would need forty days to walk from one end to the other. This accomplishment secured the respect of the Turans and laid the foundation of the Dual Kingdom. In addition to his exceptionally powerful bow, Arash is an expert commander and other bowmen will find it easier to hit their marks in his presence."

#descr "The oldest and most powerful Aboleths are called Mind Lords. They have tremendous magical and mental powers and are able to dominate lesser beings with a mere glance. They have shed the last of their dark scales and are pale and soft, but large enough not to fear anything less than an asp turtle. The Mind Lords are formidable mages of Water and the stars and have recently taken a greater interest in the Stellar Sphere. Merman stargazers who are able to leave the sea are trained in Astral magic to study a newly discovered star of auspicious importance. Mind Lords have many strange mental abilities and can cast several unique spells. In addition whilst present in an overland fort they will enable the recruitment of mentally dominated troops."

Ice elementals are stronger but slower than normal water elementals. Whilst underwater an Elemental will find it impossible to maintain a large size amongst the churning current, instead forming a core that draws from the water around it to recover wounds at a tremendous rate."

#descr "Al-Khazim is a powerful marid from an ancient time. He was the right hand of Iblis, the father of Jinn, and was among the first of his children. When the Pantokrator banished Iblis he sought to punish Al-Khazim as well, trapping him in a magic lamp and binding him to the will of whosoever holds it. If the lamp is destroyed, Al-Khazim is freed, but if it is recreated, he will instantly be trapped inside the lamp once again."

She once served the Lord of the Underworld as an executioner, but has been summoned to the mortal realm with the promise of personal gain. The Handmaiden of Death appears as a semi-transparent, winged female drenched in blood. She wields a Wraith Sword that drains the life from those it strikes."

#brief "The Dragon Kings rule over a race of halfmen below the waves. Their amphibious troops are naturally strong and armored. Coastal pirates and sacred Dragon Monks serve the Dragon Kings."
#descr "For millennia The Dragon Kings have ruled the four seas and brought storms and tidal waves to the coasts of men. Below the surface the halfmen of the Dragon Courts wage war on the tritons of Pelagia for control of the depths. In Ryugo-jo the Dragon Kings and their descendants are revered by the halfmen and accorded special status as priests and hereditary rulers.
Recently Pirate Kingdoms have emerged amongst the coastal lands around the Four Seas. These fierce brigands pay fealty to the Lords below the waves and aid them in their conquest of the surface realm. Now, with the Awakening of the New God the world will bow before the might of the Dragon Kings."
#summary "Race: Halfmen, Ryujin, Otohime, coastal humans.
Military: Aquatic Shrimp Soldiers, Amphibious Crab and Shark warriors, Elite Dragonblooded warriors, coastal sailing pirates and sacred monks.
Magic: Powerful elemental magic along with some nature.
Priests: Average."

#era 1
#descr "Nahullo is a nation of human tribes enslaved by pale skinned cannnibalistic giants. Many moons ago a group of Avvim fleeing the tyranny of the Rephaim arrived on the shores of a new land. After conquering the local tribes they instituted a Blood Cult in imitation of the Melqarts. Now they rule over the humans using their superior strength and skill at arms. Captives and those that displease their rulers are devoured in bloody rituals aping the foul appetites of the Rephaim. Some of the humans are given limited authority to rule over their fellows, and shamen skilled in dark magic pledge allegiance to their bloody overlords. The giants have retained much of their skill at war and weapon mastery and their armies are well equipped."
#summary "Race: Humans and Giants. Prefers Heat Scale +1
Military: Giants, Light infantry and archers, sacred Starnake giant warriors and powerful sacred summons.
Magic: Strong Blood and Nature, some Earth and Death.
Priests: Strong, can Blood Sacrifice"
#brief "Nahullo is a tribal nation of humans ruled by cannibal giants. Their giant warriors are well armed and armored and their mages are skilled in Blood magic."

#era 1
#descr "The Kingdom of Bhöd is a cold, mountainous land inhabited by hardy tribes and the ape-like Mi Gö. Ruled over by Tertön Kings of great wisdom the land has prospered. Sacred Lha spirits dwell in hallowed sites on the Bhöd mountain and live amongst the humans and Mi Gö. They have taught the secret of steel to the tribes and now the warriors of the Bhödpa bear fine weapons and wear scale armour. The armies of Bhöd consist of all three moeties, along with great Mammoths native to the mountains they call home.
The religion of Bhöd teaches deference to the spirits of the land and the ancestors. Shamans speak to the spirits and interpret their will to ensure prosperity for the tribes. The Tertön Kings uncover ancient wisdom which is passed down to the priests and common folk. Recently new practices including worship of the Rakshasa have begun to spread from nearby Lanka to lowland villages around the Bhöd mountains. With the coming of the new God the nation has unified and now the Bhödpa, Mi Gö and Lha spirits act as one."

#summary "Race: Humans, Lha spirits and ape-like Mi Gö. Prefers cold 2.
Military: Stealthy Bhödpa light infantry, horse and yak cavalry, sacred Lha and Mi Gö warriors.
Magic: Access to all elemental paths except fire, plus nature, death and some blood. A variety of summonable creatures.
Priests: Moderately strong; most priests are also mages."


#brief "The Bhöd Kingdom is a mountain nation. The tribesmen of the Bhöd mountain kingdom and the Mi Gö, descendants of an ancient race, fight alongside sacred Lha spirits."

#era 1
#descr "Fennoscandia is a harsh and frozen land inhabited by numerous tribes. In recent times both the Vanir and the Chudes have encroached on these lands, causing the disparate tribes to unite against a common foe. The wild Fenni, hardy Sami and pastoral Finnaithae have set aside their differences and pacts have been made with the Troldfolk living in the deep forests. Many such tribes shun civilization and can be recruited without the need for a permanent settlement. Iron is a sign of prestige and most warriors are lightly armored. 
In Fennoscandia natural objects and animals have powerful souls and are venerated. Shamanic priests speak with the souls of beasts and the dead and are accompanied in battle by protective spirits. Ancestor spirits tied to landmarks known as Seita are worshipped and consulted in all matters.

Ostlem, the capital, was a center of trade known for its beautiful windmills and tulips. After a terrible flood in which thousands drowned or perished from famine and disease Marignon's tercios conquered Rotterland. For long years blood was mixed with mud as the people struggled to push the invaders from their country. In the final battle, Ostlem was besieged. For three years the city was bombarded with fire and lightning until only the walls still stood. Finally, the last line of defense gave and Marignese pikemen surged over the walls. Suddenly the gate of the dike was opened, and an army of mermen flooded through the breach. The Marignese either fell under the sword or drowned in their trenches and mines. Ostlem was utterly destroyed, but Rotterland was free again. The armies of Rotterland use crossbows and plate armor. Their troops are accustomed to swamplands and are resistant to disease. Under the sea they can recruit mermen to aid them."

Some escaped to the vast grasslands of the northern steppes, allying with the local Tatar tribes and accepting the rule of their Khans. This alliance of tribes has since grown to become the Empire of Tartary. The armies of Tartary consist mainly of mounted warriors, with the bow and lance being favoured weapons. With the awakening of the True God the Golden Horde have now been roused to action. Streams of fierce steppes warriors pour down from the grasslands and the civilized nations of the world tremble in fear.
The Tatars revere the souls of their ancestors and sacred Shamanic priestesses interpret the will of the dead to aid the living. Lesser tribal shamans commune with spirits of the land and the eternal sky. The steppes people are unusually tolerant of foreign faiths, preferring to incorporate their worship into the empire. Captured temples will be converted rather than destroyed."

Magic and alchemy thrive in the great madrassas where erudite scholars have made many advances in mathematics, medicine, astronomy and physics. The royal Viziers practice entirely new forms of magic whilst zealous sects of assassins operate in secrecy to undermine the Caliph's enemies. In past ages the Irami people worshipped the jinn, the mysterious and elusive beings of the desert, but they have since progressed beyond those pagan ways by forcing the jinn into servitude. Now they follow the One True God whose awakening heralds a call to arms against the forces of the heathens."

One hears not only benevolent spirits of earth and sky, but also the whispers of dark spirits that crave blood and sacrifice. Those who consort with these malevolent spirits are known as Skinwalkers, able to change their form between man and beast. In ages past, these Skinwalkers were banished from the tribes by the Speakers. As invaders continued to conquer and occupy Nihualan lands, more and more tribes were willing to consort with the Skinwalkers in a desperate bid to save their people. Eventually these dark mystics replaced the Speakers entirely, and installed themselves as the ruling order of Nihuala. The once-placid lands of Nihuala are now deep, dark woodlands where witches stalk and the sound of distant howling is incessant. Raiders emerge from the forests to ravage enemy lands, returning with supplies and captives to appease their masters."

#selectnation 166
#name "Venedia"
#epithet "Merchant Princes"
#era 3
#descr "Venedia is an aristocratic republic that was originally a coastal colony of Marignon. Growing wealthy through trade and industry, they chafed under the burden of both taxes and the Inquisition and eventually decided to rebel. Through cunning and intrigue they eventually managed to secede and become an independent nation, and now the ruler of Venedia is elected for life by the leaders of the most powerful merchant families.
The people of this nation are known for their skill in sailing and trading rather than warfare. Venedia's regular melee troops are not especially brave or well-trained, but are supported by mercenaries, hot-blooded bravos and skilled crossbowmen known for their accuracy.
The mages of Venedia are skilled and versatile. Every coastal city of the republic trains mage-navigators, and the wealthy nobles grant patronage to practitioners of many arcane crafts such as alchemy, astronomy, medicine and engineering."
#brief "Venedia is an aristocratic republic of skilled sailors and cunning merchants. Their regular melee troops are not especially skilled, but their crossbowmen are known for their accuracy and Venedian armies can also rely on hired bravos, mercenaries and versatile mages."
#summary "Race: Humans, ocean sailing, income bonus in coastal castles and can recruit navigators
Military: Crossbowmen, medium infantry, cavalry, skill. Mercenaries are cheaper

He was given dominion over the Sky and the Winds and everything in the air. During the rebellion against the Pantokrator he allowed the Sun to remain in the sky and for this he was punished with eternal imprisonment. Now with the Pantokrator gone his shackles are weakening and vast thunder clouds are gathering. Soon he will be free to claim all beneath the sky once more. In combat he will manifest gems of Air magic to aid in spellcasting."

He would cause death and lamentation to the world. He saw that everything in the world would come under his reign sooner or later, but this was not entirely true. Dominion over the cycle of death was shared with his brother Vucub Came, Seven Death. He was given the end of the cycle by the Pantokrator. Hun Came came to realize that his brother represented the end of Hun Came authority and he became jealous. The One Death shared his powers with nine lieutenants, the Bolon-ti-ku, the Nine-Gods, and with their aid he slew his brother and ended the cycle of death and rebirth. With the breach of the natural order set up by the Pantokrator the world became depopulated, wild and inhospitable. The world was plunged into darkness and the dead threatened to replace the living. The Pantokrator became furious and punished his rebellious servant with eternal imprisonment. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the prison of the Hun Came is weakening and the world might once more be plunged in Darkness. In combat he can manifest magical earth and death gems to aid in spellcasting."

When the Fomorians rebelled against the Pantokrator and ravaged the world, the Son of the Sea was punished for having given them the means to escape their prison land. The Son of the Sea was imprisoned for millennia, but with the Pantokrator gone, his shackles are weakening and he is ready to enter the world of the living as God and ruler of all. The Son of the Sea is strongly attuned to the sea and the storms, but his task of guiding the souls of the dead has given him great powers over the dead. He is a master of trickery and illusions and can hide his true appearance. With his ship, 'Wave Sweeper', he can bring his followers across the sea, or he can bless them with water-breathing.

She is attended by a pack of werewolves that do her bidding. Even though her werewolf form is more powerful than her human form, it is still quite weak when compared to the majority of the other Pretender Gods. Werewolves flock to her dominion, and whenever she goes into battle, wolves will come to her aid. Wolves fighting with the Bitch Queen will be granted her protection and will be difficult to harm with mortal weapons."

But the Raven grew too close to death and the Pantokrator was afraid that it served the Lord of the Underworld rather than himself. The Pantokrator banished the great bird for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Herald of Death and Slaughter can return to the world of men and bring whispers of death to come. The Raven of the Underworld feeds on the dead and regains hit points if enough corpses are present. Those slain by the Raven may be forced to rise again to defend it in battle."

#selectmonster 2930 -- Hooded Spirit
#descr "The Hooded Spirits is an entity consisting of three spirits of fertility and growth. It was given the divine spark by a goddess of a sacred spring and served her faithfully until the previous Pantokrator rose to power. When the Pantokrator banished all gods the Hooded Spirits were spared and given the task of bringing fertility and prosperity to all mankind. But the spirits were seduced by men and sired offspring with divine sparks. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his servants for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the hooded spirits are once more able to enter the world and bring fertility to the land. The Hooded Spirits are able to unify at any time which will bring the spirits together no matter how far apart they are."

This is highly dangerous to those that use binding magic to control powerful and vengeful beings such as the denizens of the lower planes. Whilst this spell is in effect any creature summoned with a spell of binding may break free and attempt to attack a commander in their province. Larger concentrations of such beings increase the likelihood of an attack. Unique creatures that break their bindings will instead quickly escape back to their own realm. This spell was first used to overthrow the ancient King Solomon who controlled many Demons through the use of a magic ring."

The mass is corrosive and infectious, and it will consume living matter and convert it into more of the loathsome stuff. The main mass releases spores that infect living beings and will slowly spread through their body even without direct contact. Any creature it slays will be used to create a smaller version of itself, which has the same properties as the original. After the battle the animating magic will fade and the creature and all its creations will collapse into festering piles of ooze."

The mage will then find and attempt to rescue the spirit of a great Sorceress. This spell is highly dangerous, as if caught the mage will have to remain in the underworld forever. In return the spirit will return to the world of the living to aid the Awakening God. More nimble mages will have a higher chance of evading the guards of the Underworld and returning to the world of the living."

Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact secret rituals to protect themselves from heavenly retribution. However, this is not a true form of immortality and eventually the agents of the Heavens will find the Shije Xian and enact retribution"

Strains of this tune will drift over a nearby forest, calling the populace to cast away the trappings of civilization. Many military units will be unable to resist the call and will escape into the forest however those who are strong of mind or duty will resist the call. In addition some of the populace will become maddened, attacking any defenders present. This will cause great turmoil in the province."

The Black Bull is a creature of unbridled fury and a manifestation of the blind rage of Nature, the inhuman wildness, the glory of the slayer and the slain. The White Bull has long been worshipped as a manifestation of the wildness and fertility of Nature and his fury and potency are unrivaled. The caster calls on the Divine Bulls to trample the enemies of the True God beneath their cloven hooves. Each month the Bulls will manifest across the world to destroy the enemies of the faith. In addition, whilst the spell remains the casters lands will be bountiful and produce additional income per Growth scale present. This enchantment lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies."

The majority of any army present in the province will die from this powerful attack, but since the entire army is rarely gathered in one camp at a given time, only half of the target province's army can be expected to be struck by the weapon. In addition thousands upon thousands of people will die and the province targeted will become entirely barren for a full year due to the destructive power unleashed."

In this gruesome ritual the caster consumes the blood and flesh of ritually purified sacrifices, aswell as copious amount of monkey flesh taken from the local populace. The flesh and blood of the victims rejuvenates the caster, healing him of all or at least most afflictions. Bloodmages who partake too often in blood feasts often develop uncontrollable cravings for more flesh. These cravings are seen as a sign of divine favour and celebrated in Lanka. The ritual does not work on inanimate beings."

In this gruesome ritual the caster consumes the blood and flesh of ritually purified sacrifices, aswell as copious amount of flesh taken from the local population. The flesh and blood of the victims rejuvenates the caster, healing him of all or at least most afflictions. Bloodmages who partake too often in blood feasts often develop uncontrollable cravings for more flesh. The Kohen Gadol teach that these cravings are a sign the power of the Melqarts is returning. The ritual does not work on inanimate beings."

Of the Telkhine kingdom only a few islands remain, inhabited by survivors of the cataclysm. On these islands the living serve the unaware dead out of fear and respect. On the islands of the shattered kingdom also live the Daktyloi, dwarven smiths and servants of the Telkhines. With the death of of the Telkhines the Daktyloi replaced them and became revered by the Therodian ghosts.

With the coming of the new God it must choose between embracing the new life and vitality of the living, or remain trapped in the past as a kingdom of the dead."

#name "Sacred Phurba"
#descr "This odd knife, with its 3-edged blade made from consecrated bone and tempered by Shambhalan enchanters, is enchanted to be particularly potent at slaying demons, and can often cast off the evil spirits of disease from someone touched by its pommel. It bears special enchantments that aid its bearer's spells in affecting enemies and give some protection from theirs. Anyone who slays someone holding a Sacred Phurba will be cursed for the rest of his life."

#descr "This diamond-encrusted, sacred ritual mace is infused with the power of many astral pearls and anointed with a tear of the awakening god, such that it grants its bearer a particularly sacred status. It gives great magical benefits to its bearer, not least of which is an aspect of holiness that can make the unsteady hesitate to attack, and which even strike unbelievers with thunderbolts of enlightenment. Every month it generates an astral pearl good for immediate use, but not stable enough to keep longer."

#descr "The craftsmen of Venedia are skilled glassworkers and sometimes even use magic in their work. This telescope is one of their most impressive inventions: it is light enough to be held in one hand and its crystal lens is enchanted so that spells can be cast through it, greatly improving their accuracy. When used for stargazing, the holder will be able to discern otherwise unseen celestial patterns and use them to increase the range of Astral rituals."

#descr "Masks are an important part of Venetian culture and are often worn at balls, carnivals and all sorts of important social events. Those worn by nobles can be extremely elaborate and sometimes even enchanted. This mask is designed to be worn by Casanovas and Columbines to enhance their charms and dazzle would-be attackers. The latter power often proves useful when the objects of their affections violently reject their advances - or when they are caught in the act by a jealous husband or wife."
