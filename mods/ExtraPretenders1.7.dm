Each aspect of the Goddess was imprisoned separately to prevent their combined strength from overcoming his bonds. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the shackles are weakening and the Triple Goddess will soon return to guide her daughters once more. The Goddess now resides in three bodies, the Maiden, the Mother and the Crone. The Maiden is the promise of new beginnings and will cause living things to bloom and ripen. She skilled in the primal magic of Fire and Air. The Mother is the power of life and can heal sickness and disease. She is skilled in the hearty magic of Blood and Water.

Each aspect of the Goddess was imprisoned separately to prevent their combined strength from overcoming his bonds. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the shackles are weakening and the Triple Goddess will soon return to guide her daughters once more.

The Crone is the wisdom of age and can predict future events with great accuracy. She is skilled in the arcane magic of Astral and Death."

The being has grown to enormous proportions with passing aeons and is now worshipped by the Starspawns as a bringer of the Void. The Formless One can regenerate wounds and will use its great bulk to crush those that oppose it in battle."

Now with the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves once more.

#name "Bull Demon King"
#descr "The Bull Demon King is a Lord of the Underworld that can take the form of a gigantic white Bull. In ages past he terrorised the people of the world until the Pantokrator bid the Celestial General lead his armies to subdue him and trap him in the Underworld. The Bull Demon King is powerful but arrogant, and is the most senior of the Demon Kings. He likes to think of himself as equal to the great sages of heaven and will become furious if his wisdom is questioned. Now, with the Pantrokrator gone the Bull Demon King will once more rule the realm of men. In Bull form he is physically powerful but it is not well suited for spellcasting."

#name "Peacock Angel"
#descr "At the beginning of time the Pantokrator created seven angelic beings from his own illumination. Foremost was the Peacock Angel, a being of light itself. Upon creating the first man from the dust of the earth the Pantokrator decreed all the angels must bow before it, however the Peacock Angel refused. He reasoned a being of light should not bow before a creature of the dust. At this the other angels cried out and called him a Devil and a Heretic. The Pantokrator however praised him for seeing the truth and bade him sit at the side of the Throne of Heaven. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the Peacock Angel will take his place and bestow blessings and misfortune as he sees fit. Anyone striking at his glory will in turn be struck by awe and blindness. In combat he can manifest gems of Water, Air and Nature magic to aid in spellcasting."

In time he had two daughters, the Morning Star and Evening Star, who would open and close the gates for his great chariot to aid him in his task. As the people of the world saw the life giving rays of the sun they began to worship it above the Pantokrator and he grew jealous of his child. He imprisoned the Sun Father along with his two offspring in a pit from which no light could escape and gave the task of driving the Sun Chariot to another. Now, with the Pantokrator departed, the Sun Father has returned along with his daughters to claim his birthright and ascend the Throne of Heaven. The Sun Father is skilled in all the magic of the skies, whilst his two daughters are skilled in the magic of the air and the stars. His Daughters will lose some magical power whilst away from their Father, however he can call them to him in times of need with but a word."

This being saw all that occurred, and reported to the Pantokrator each sin committed so that punishment could be assigned. Over time the being grew fond of the creatures over which it watched, and no longer wished to cause them pain and suffering. He took great golden bands and sealed them over his eyes, that he would not be able to see their sins. When the Pantokrator discovered such treachery he bound his servant below the earth for eternity. Now the shackles grow weaker and the Lord of Mysteries can return to the world he covets. He has three heads for watching the three realms, however the golden bands that block his sight cannot be removed.

Now the Pantokrator has departed and the Triad can once more return to the world to claim the Throne of Heaven."

#descr "The Titan of the Night is a giant of divine heritage. She was born out of chaos in ancient times and claimed dominion over the night and darkness in all its forms. She gave birth to the Keres, the bloodthirsty daimones of the underworld, and rules them as their queen. In time even the Pantokrator grew fearful of her and bound her in a great cave at the entrance to Tartarus. With the Pantokrator gone it is rumoured she may have already broken her chains and stalks the world unseen. The Titan of the Night can become invisible at will, but sometimes appears as a gaunt winged figure robed in bloody garments. The Titan of the Night is more powerful in darkness and her touch can drain the life from the living. Each month her children will bring her slaves of pure blood, and in combat she will manifest a magic pearl and a death gem for use in spellcasting."

It has been worshipped since the dawn of time by the beings of the sea who provide offerings of fish. Countless offerings later and now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ancient Anemone has the chance to put the world under its strong dominion and becoming the True God. The Anemone cannot move around, but it is also tremendously difficult to kill in combat and can sting attackers with its poisonous tentacles."

The Kings spend most of their time staring into the Dark Crystal  and in the pale light of the Basalt Kings' antennae, shades and movements can be seen that predict future events. The Crystal can control the minds of the weak willed and the Basalt Kings divine its will from the movements.

#descr "After the death of the Prophet his remains were kept in the temple of the Holy City of Eldregate and venerated as relics while the nation awaited the coming of the mysteryous New God he had promised. 
Replicas of the shrouds he wore were made and used by his most devoted followers to heal the sick and wounded, and faithful from all around the Empire made pilgrimages to to Eldregate to offer prayers and sacrifices to the Prophet's tomb.
As the focus of such devotion the Reliquary gained great spiritual power. One day as many followers of the New Faith were praying it suddenly began to shine with celestial light. More and stronger miracles manifested, and it was clear a powerful spirit had bound itself to the remains.
The Bishops were quick to declare the New God they had been waiting for had awakened, and it was the Prophet himself who had ascended to the Celestial sphere after his death to wait for the time when the faith of the people would be strong enough to call him back to the world, and make him into the God he had promised.
Now Ermor follows the Second Coming of the Prophet, confident that he will lead the Empire to glory and dominion over the whole world."

The goal was resurrect the Prophet, for many had come to believe that he would bring an age of wealth and prosperity where Ermor held ultimate dominion over the world.
However the ritual failed catastrophically: there was no resurrection but rather the spiritual barriers between the worlds of the dead and the living were shattered and Death was brought forth, killing tens of thousands. 
Now a powerful spirit of the Underworld is bound to the Prophet's tomb, turning the land to ash and desolation as its dominion spread.
The Unholy Reliquary is surrounded by a terrifying life-draining aura and because of its close connection to the Underworld generates two Death gems every month."

Eventually however the Pantokrator began to fear that in their enlightenment the people might turn away from him, and thus bound the spirit to a huge stone statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshipped as a reawakening god. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."
