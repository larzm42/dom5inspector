Their howls draw lesser wolves to their aid and they are always accompanied by a pack of fell beasts."

In the catastrophe that caused the star to fall it fell into a deep death-slumber until the stars were right for it to live again. Few amongst the Starspawn know that K'llulu actually engineered the event that caused the star to fall in order to open up new worlds to conquer. Now awoken it will once more lead the Starspawn to absolute domination. K'llulu is a terrifying sight and many will falter at the mere sight of it. As a creature partially of the void it is a master of Astral magic and adept in the paths of Death and Water, and as High Priest its religious authority is absolute amongst the starspawn. The mind of K'llulu is strongly intertwined with the Void and its very presence will spread the Dominion of the Awakening God. As long as the stars remain right the creature cannot be truly destroyed and will reform in R'lyeh if killed, however if the stars are no longer right it will return to a restless torpor. Like all Illithids it is amphibious and can blast the minds of weaker beings."

The necromancer must substitute a bewitched object for their corpse or slip a Death certificate into the coffin of a newly departed relative. This has the effect of removing their name from the ledgers kept by the Heavenly Controller of Fate. As a side effect spells dealing with the undead will also affect a Shije Xian. Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact secret rituals to protect themselves from heavenly retribution. However, this is not a true form of immortality and eventually the agents of the Heavens will find the Shije Xian and end its unnatural existence."

Bake-Danuki are stealthy and in human guise have the abilities of a spy, however their mischevious nature will cause unrest amongst the populace. Danzaburou is a powerful mage of Nature and Air magic and occasionally dabbles in other magic."

#descr "A bronze clockwork soldier is a spring-driven, automated warrior made of bronze. The spring of the clockwork soldier is wound up before battle and the soldier is released close to the front of the battle and pointed at the enemy. The clockwork soldier then quickly walks forward driven by its magical springs. If everything goes as expected, the clockwork soldier will use its sword to tear into the enemy ranks and its shield will whirl around in a random fashion to block enemy attacks. Fortunately, the springs and clockworks powering the soldier will only allow for a short burst of frantic attacks before they need to be wound up again."

She can also take the form of a large raven to pick the eyes from the dead, and is thus sometimes known as the 'Battle Crow'. She is known to cause fear and confusion among soldiers to move the tide of battle to her favour. She is often seen at the site of terrible battles and the Fir Bolg sometimes refer to a battlefield as 'The Garden of Badb'. Any army that fights against Badb will suffer a horrible curse and will forever have bad luck in combat."

The brightest was Rossum, who devised a means for creating synthetic creatures he termed 'Robots'. These created servants revolutionised Agartha and lead to its dominance over the other nations. Now Rossum has been summoned to aid in the ascension war and will create an army of Robots to serve the Awakening God. Rossum will create factories in any forted province he visits. His knowledge of anatomy is highly advanced and he can cure any disease or ailment. He has knowledge of future magical discoveries and can greatly aid in magical research."

They are impervious to pain and extremely hardy, and as such can work much harder and longer than most other races. In their future dimension they have become the mainstay of the workforce and have transformed Agartha into a world dominating power. Some say that Robots can display independent thought and may one day become a threat to their creators, however Rossum dismisses this as impossible. Robots cost no gold to recruit, however resources must still be expended for their creation."

Some say it hails from the same distant star as the Illithid, whilst others claim it is a particularly intelligent and malevolent void being. It is not truly alive or dead, not entirely of this world or the void. The King moves through the void and can barely be harmed by mortal means. It is served by twisted creatures known as Swine-Things and spreads insanity and despair in its wake. Whilst in combat the King will open a channel to the void and drain the life force from all living beings in the vicinity."

#descr "Selkies are ancient sea spirits of trickery and mist. When venturing onto land they take the form of human women however their natural form is that of a pure white seal. Selkies in human form are strikingly beautiful and few mortals would think to harm one. Many young men have become besotted after seeing one remove their magical sealskin cloak on a deserted beach. Selkies are powerful mages of illusion and the wild. When in the water their skills in nature magic are increased, whilst on land they are stronger in air magic. Selkies are free spirits and do not enjoy the rigours of magical research. In seal shape they are unsuited for the task of forging magical items, however they can call upon Hippocampoi to aid them each month. The Selkie is always surrounded by a thick mist that will obscure vision."

These Debauched Libertines are inspired by infernal temptations to plumb the very depths of sensation.

Usually only wealthy nobles have the leisure time to devote themselves fully to such activities, and some even turn to studying dark arts to further indulge their forbidden urges. An outward veneer of respectability allows such individuals to travel unnoticed in foreign lands, however a province containing a Debauched Libertine will experience increased unrest as rumours of their activities reach the common folk. They often employ miscreants to aid them in their unsavoury tasks."

#descr "The first and most powerful Amaru was a chimeric being forged from water, light and earth. This jet black being blended the form of the noble llama, divine bird and sacred serpent. It first created a great river filled with magnificent abundance and took pride in the results of its work. The pantokrator rewarded the Black Amaru with stewardship over the realm and a duty to protect its human inhabitants. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator the creature is barred from entering the mortal realm and can only be called through powerful magic. It is strong in the magic of the water, the earth and the starlight from which it was made. The people of Nazca revere the Black Amaru and it has great priestly powers."

Now freed once more he will serve the Awakening God in gratitude, however Anu has not forgotten his dreams of empire. His divine presence will draw worship away from the True God, and when outside friendly Dominion he may turn to thoughts of rebellion once more.

#descr "There are several races of giants in the land of Hinnom. The Rephaim are the sons of the Nephilim and the undisputed rulers of the land. They are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught the secrets of war by their fathers and are formidable warriors. The Rephaim have gruesome appetites and many of them feast on the flesh of their smaller kin. They will devour food, beasts, men and kin and as long as there is population in a province, they do not starve, although the populace will suffer. They are much feared by the Avvim and Horim and are considered sacred. This Rephaite bears arms and armor that radiate heat from the forge of Azazel and has been granted the title of Dawn Warrior."

The Blacksteel armor of Ulm is made by the master smiths and their superior craftsmanship is obvious to anyone wearing an Ulmish armor. Both stronger and lighter than ordinary plate armor, they make the soldiers of Ulm superior to any other human infantry. Inspired by the presence of an Iron Angel to create almost supernaturally sharp weaponry, the black iron infantry have higher morale than even the black plate infantry of Ulm. The inhabitants of Ulm are large and can endure much physical punishment before collapsing. The influence of the Iron Angel has imbued their armor with some resistance to magic."

Azazel was the leader of the Watchers and the first one to sin. He alone taught the Avvim how to make war, how to make weapons and how to make and use cosmetics. Now released from his long imprisonment in Tartarus, Azazel has lost much however still has tremendous power. His mind has suffered from the aeons of perpetual pain and he often lashes out in anger. The body of the ancient angel is dead, but his willpower keeps it alive in a state of constant decay. In his undead state he has lost some of his power over Blood, however he has gained in knowledge of Death. As progenitor of the Rephaites Azazel has great priestly powers amongst the Anakim and any that fight alongside him will feel the blessing of the Lord upon them."

Sauromancers from C'tis were invited by the Emperor and his Theurgs to battle the growing threat and with them came the Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult was heralded as the answer to the Ermorian threat and quickly received Imperial acceptance. Soon it replaced the Order of the Theurgs as the state cult and grew in influence and power. In the years that have passed since the lizards left Pythium, the Cult has changed. Serpents are venerated and the priests of the Cult wear serpent masks and carry serpent staffs as signs of their office. This Serpent Priest has taken the role of Bishop to lead the cult as the primary religion of the Empire."

#descr "The Picts are an isolated tribe that lives in the frigid corner of an ancient island near Marverni. Long ago they retreated to their isle and became creatures of myth and legend, appearing only rarely to raid far flung villages on nights of the full moon. The Picts adorn themselves with tattoos daubed in blue woad, a special paint made from sacred herbs that grow only on their island, and which they believe will grant them fortune in battle. The Picts are stealthy warriors, however in battle they succumb to bloodlust and are gripped with battle fury. The tattoos of the Picts must be awoken with magic. Pictish Chieftains are revered by the tribes of Marverni and have some priestly authority, in addition to rudimentary knowledge of the magic of the forest."

#name "Serpent Aspirant"
#descr "Serpent Priests are the leaders of the Pythian Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult is one of the many mystery cults that spread to Pythium during the collapse of Ermor. Sauromancers from C'tis were invited by the Emperor and his Theurgs to battle the growing threat and with them came the Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult was heralded as the answer to the Ermorian threat and quickly received Imperial acceptance. Soon it replaced the Order of the Theurgs as the state cult and grew in influence and power. In the years that have passed since the lizards left Pythium, the Cult has changed. Serpents are venerated and the priests of the Cult wear serpent masks and carry serpent staffs as signs of their office. This Serpent Priest aspires to become the Serpent Bishop and cement the Serpent Cult as the official state church."

#descr "Throughout the Empire, mystery cults have spread and flourished with the influx of foreign culture. One of these, the Serpent Cult, has replaced the official state cult of the Theurgs, but many others ply their trade in secret. The Cult of the Great Mother is very popular among women and most of the members in its higher ranks are female. The Epoptes is a high ranking member of the Cult of the Great Mother. The liturgy of the mystery cult is heavily influenced by the Arcoscephalean priestesses and their skill in healing. Like all mystics of the Empire, the Epoptes leads worshippers astray and lowers the Dominion in which she resides. She wears a garland and a green dress and carries an urn and a twig as signs of her office. The urn is enchanted and is always full of grain. This Epoptes aspires to become the Archigalluus and establish the Fertility cult as the official state church."

The Cult of the Solar Bull is very popular among the soldiers of the Limes and most of its higher members are former soldiers or Centurions. The Heliodromus, Sun-Courier, is the highest ranking member of the Cult of the Solar Bull. He, for it is only males that are allowed in the Cult, performs the Taurobolium, ritual sacrifice of a bull. The Heliodromus carries a golden sacrificial knife. Like all mystics of the Empire, the Heliodromus leads worshippers astray and lowers the Dominion in which he resides. He wears an exotic hat, reputedly similar to those of the foreign founders of the Cult. The Heliodromus forswears his former life upon initiation and does not lead armies.

#selectmonster 634 -- Handmaiden of Death
#descr "A Handmaiden of Death is an angelic being of hideous appearance. She once served the Lord of the Underworld as an executioner, but has been summoned to the mortal realm with the promise of personal gain. The Handmaiden of Death appears as a semi-transparent, winged female drenched in blood. She wields a Wraith Sword that drains the life from those it strikes."

#descr "The oldest and most powerful Aboleths are called Mind Lords. They have tremendous magical and mental powers and are able to dominate lesser beings with a mere glance. They have shed the last of their dark scales and are pale and soft, but large enough not to fear anything less than an asp turtle. The Mind Lords are formidable mages of Water and the stars and have recently taken a greater interest in the Stellar Sphere. Merman stargazers who are able to leave the sea are trained in Astral magic to study a newly discovered star of auspicious importance. Mind Lords have many strange mental abilities and can cast several unique spells. In addition whilst present in an overland fort they will enable the recruitment of mentally dominated troops."

This will increase Death scales within friendly Dominion and Death gems can be harvested from the icy winds. More undead will animate in provinces with higher death scales and the winds of death may hasten the end for a few unfortunate souls.

In times past noblemen would be buried along with their most devoted retainers, however a great Emperor declared the practice cruel and forbade it. Since then warriors made of terracotta have been buried to guard the Emperor on his journey to heaven. These Terracotta warriors are also used in warfare, given strange life by the Celestial Masters. Terracotta Soldiers are highly resistant to fire, but are somewhat brittle if struck by blunt weapons."

The necromancer must substitute a bewitched object for their corpse or slip a Death certificate into the coffin of a newly departed relative. This has the effect of removing their name from the ledgers kept by the Heavenly Controller of Fate. Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact secret rituals to protect themselves from heavenly retribution. However, this is not a true form of immortality and eventually the agents of the Heavens will find the Shije Xian and enact retribution"

If they cannot locate a temple in the province they will simply run amok, causing unrest amongst the populace. When they have completed their rampage they will return to their abode in Yomi."

A Miko is a shrine maiden of Jomon, trained in tasks ranging from ritual cleansing to performing the sacred dances. Some Miko receive visions or even become possessed by the Kami for short periods. Once the ritual is complete the Miko will have great magical and priestly powers, and will be able to command the Kami of the land. The spirit of the Awakening God can only inhabit one Divinely bonded Miko at a time, and attempts to bond a second will fail. This ritual requires long and careful preparations and will not be successful if cast whilst the province is under siege."

Before the fall it stood at the entrance to the Great Harbour in Therodos guarding the capital against enemy assault. Once rebuilt the statue will be inhabited by a powerful spirit of the earth first bound into it long ago by Demonax himself. As a symbol of the power of Therodos it was known across the world, and once rebuilt spectral former inhabitants of the great city will arrive in great numbers. Whilst it is present the capital will be very hard to besiege, as the colossus counts as 100 men when defending a castle."

After the fall of Ermor the Goetic Masters maneuvered to gain vast political influence in the kingdom. One of their first actions was to accuse the Knights of the Chalice of consorting with devils. The Knights were all burnt at the stake in disgrace and their assets confiscated. Few knew this was actually an offering to the Infernal lords and the souls of the Knights were trapped in Hell. With the acceptance of devil worship the Knights have been reconsecrated into the faith and can be summoned to fight for the Awakening God once more. This spell can only be cast at the House of Justice."
